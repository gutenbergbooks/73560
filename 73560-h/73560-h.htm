<p>“What does cookery mean? It means the knowledge
of Medea, and of Circe, and of Calypso, and
of Helen, and of Rebekah, and of the Queen of
Sheba. It means knowledge of all herbs, and
fruits, and balms, and spices, and of all that is
healing and sweet in groves, and savoury in meat.
It means carefulness and inventiveness, watchfulness,
willingness, and readiness of appliances. It
means the economy of your Great-grandmother,
and the Science of modern chemistry, and French
art, and Arabian hospitality. It means, in fine,
that you are to see imperatively that every one has

<p>“There does not at this blessed moment breathe
on the Earth’s surface a human being that willna
prefer eating and drinking to all ither pleasures
o’ body or soul.”—<span class="smcap">The Ettrick Shepherd.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Every</span> bachelor has a wife of some sort.
Mine is a Chafing Dish; and I desire to
sing her praises.</p>

<p>My better half—I love to call her Chaffinda,
and to dwell upon the doubled consonant—is
a nickel-plated dish on a wrought-iron
stand, with a simple spirit-lamp wherewith
to keep herself warm. I bought her at
Harrod’s Stores for twelve shillings and
ninepence—and she has sisters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>It has been borne in upon me that many
quite nice folk may be glad to learn something
of the possibilities of Chaffinda.
Whether married or single, there are moments
in the life of nearly every man and woman
when the need of a quick, hot, and light
little meal is worth much fine gold. To
such I would politely address myself.</p>

<p>The ordinary domestic cook is a tireless
enemy of the Chafing Dish. She calls it
“fiddle-faddle.” Maybe. But inasmuch as
it is clean, economical, speedy and rather
simple, it would naturally not appeal to her
peculiar sense of the culinary art.</p>

<p>To bachelors, male and female, in chambers,
lodgings, diggings, and the like, in fact to
all who “batch”; to young couples with a
taste for theatres, concerts, and homely late
suppers; to yachtsmen, shooting-parties, and
picnickers; to inventive artists who yearn for
fame in the evolution of a new entrée; to
invalids, night workers, actors and stockbrokers,
the Chafing Dish is a welcome friend
and companion.</p>

<p>It has its limitations, of course, but they
are few and immaterial, and its obvious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
advantages and conveniences far outweigh its
trivial drawbacks. At the same time it must
be remembered that it is a serious cooking
apparatus, and by no means a mere toy.</p>

<p>It is quite erroneous to imagine that the
Chafing Dish is an American invention.
Nothing of the sort. The earliest trace of it
is more than a quarter of a thousand years
old. “Le Cuisinier Français,” by Sieur
François Pierre de la Varenne, Escuyer de
Cuisine de Monsieur le Marquis d’Uxelles,
published in Paris in 1652, contains a recipe
for <i>Champignons à l’Olivier</i>, in which the use
of a <i>Réchaut</i> is recommended. A translation
of this work, termed “The French Cook,”
was published in London in 1653, and the
selfsame recipe of <i>Mushrooms after the Oliver</i>
contains the injunction to use a Chafing
Dish; moreover, the frontispiece, a charmingly
executed drawing, shows a man-cook
in his kitchen, surrounded by the implements
of his art; and on the table a Chafing Dish,
much akin to our latter-day variety, is burning
merrily. This was in 1653. The <i>Mayflower</i>
sailed in 1620.</p>

<p>So much for the antiquity of the Chafing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Dish. At the same time our mitigated
thanks are due to America for its comparatively
recent reintroduction, for until quite
lately, in Great Britain, its use was practically
limited to the cooking of cheese on the table.
The Chafing Dish is much esteemed across
the Atlantic, although one is forced to admit
that it is sometimes put to base uses in the
concoction of unholy stews, which have not
the natural flavour of fish, flesh or fowl, or
even good red herring. Still, if the Americans
are vague in their French nomenclature, unorthodox
in their sauces, eclectic in their
flavourings, and over-lavish in their condiments,
yet they have at any rate brought
parlour cooking to a point where it may
gracefully be accepted as an added pleasure
to life.</p>

<p>When two or three are gathered together,
and one mentions the magic word “Chafing
Dish,” the second invariably chimes in with
“Welsh Rabbit.” This is an error of taste,
but excusable in the circumstances. Chafing
Dishes were not created for the exclusive
canonisation of Welsh Rabbits, although a
deft hand may occasionally play with one in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
a lightsome mood. There are other and
better uses. All the same, a fragrant and
delicate Rabbit is not to be despised, although
it must not be made conceited by too great an
elevation into the realms of high cookery.</p>

<p>My Chaffinda has at least seventeen hundred
and four different charms, therein somewhat
exceeding the average number appertaining
to her sex, but it would require volumes to
mention them separately, and it must suffice
to indicate roughly a few of the more
prominent.</p>

<p>I suppose that every nation has the cooks
that it deserves, and, if this be accepted as an
axiom, the general degeneration of the Plain
Cook of the middle classes amply accounts
for the growing cult of the Chafing Dish.
The British school of cookery, in its
mediocre form, is monotony exemplified.
Too many broths spoil the cook; and hence
we derive our dull sameness of roast and
boiled.</p>

<p>Sweet are the juices of diversity, and whilst
there is no reason for the Chafer to elaborate
a sauce of thirteen ingredients, the cunning
manipulation of three or four common articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of the domestic store-cupboard will often
give (intentionally or otherwise) surprising
results. This I shall hope to explain more
fully later on.</p>

<p>Imagination and a due sense of proportion
are as necessary in cooking as in any other
art—more so than in some, for Impressionism
in the kitchen simply means indigestion.
Digestion is the business of the human
interior, indigestion that of the doctor. It is
so easy to cook indigestible things that a
savoury cunningly concocted of Bismuth and
Pepsine would seem an almost necessary
adjunct to the menu (or <i>Carte Dinatoire</i>, as
the French Revolutionists called it) of the
budding Chafist.</p>

<p>But the demon of indigestion may easily
be exorcised with a little care and thought.
Three great apothegms should be borne in
mind. Imprimis: Never worry your food;
let it cook out its own salvation. Item:
Use as few highly spiced condiments as
possible; and, lastly, keep to natural flavours,
juices, and sauces.</p>

<p>Much modern depravity, for instance, I
attribute to the unholy cult of Mayonnaise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
(or Mahonnaise, or Bayonnaise, or Magnonaise,
according to different culinary
authorities). At its best it is simply a saucy
disguise to an innocent salmon or martial
lobster, reminding the clean-palated of an old
actor painted up to look young. I once
knew a man who proposed to a girl at a
dance-supper simply because he could not
think of anything else to say, and suddenly
discovered that they both hated Mayonnaise.
I have no reason to suppose that they are
unhappy.</p>

<p>At the same time I am in no wise against
trying new dishes, new combinations of subtle
flavours, if they do not obliterate the true
taste of the basis. An experimental evening
with Chaffinda, when one is not sure how
things are going to turn out, is, I find, most
exhilarating, and a sure cure for the blues.
But I am fain to admit that on such occasions
I always provide a chunk of Benoist pressed
beef as a stand-by in case of emergency.</p>

<p>There is nothing final about the Chafing
Dish.</p>

<p>Another point about having a wife in the
shape of a Chafing Dish is somewhat delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to explain. Coarsely indicated, it amounts
to this. Continuous intercourse with such a
delicious, handy and resourceful helpmeet
tends to a certain politeness in little things, a
dainty courtesy which could not be engendered
by the constant companionship of
a common kitchen-range. Chafing-Dish
cookery bears the same relation to middle-class
kitchen cookery that the delightful art
of fencing does to that of the broadsword.
Both are useful, but there is a world of subtle
differentiation between the two. The average
rough and tumble of the domestic saucepan
contrasts with the deft manipulation of the
miniature battery of tiny pans.</p>

<p>And politeness always pays; moreover, it
is vastly becoming. I gave a little tea-party
recently to some dear children. Some of
them were twins. Edith, a female twin of
nine, asked me to help her to some more
blackberry jam. “Certainly, Edith,” I said;
“but why don’t you help yourself?” The
maid was even politer than she was hungry:
“Because I was afraid I should not take
enough.” And thus we learn how things
work among manikinkind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>There are some who delight in the flavour
of onions. I do myself—but then I am a
bachelor. Politeness and onions form one of
life’s most persistent inconsistencies. His
Most Gracious Majesty King George IV., it
is recorded, attempted to kiss a royal housemaid,
who said: “Sir, your language both
shocks and appals me; besides which, your
breath smells of onions!” And again, in a
Cambridge dining-room, a framed notice on
the wall stated: “Gentlemen partial to
spring onions are requested to use the table
under the far window.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the benefits of onions toward
the human race are probably not less than
those attendant on the discovery of steam. It
is a vegetable whose manifold properties and
delights have never been properly sung. As
a gentle stimulant, a mild soporific, a democratic
leveller of exaggeration in flavour, a
common bond between prince and peasant, it
is a standing protest of Nature against Art.</p>

<p>On my wall, as I write, hangs a delightful
oil study of a clump of onions in flower,
which the deft artist aptly dubs <i>Le Fond de
la Cuisine</i>. Dr. William King said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
“Onions can make even heirs or widows
weep”; and the “Philosopher’s Banquet,”
written in 1633, seems to meet the case excellently:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If Leekes you like, but do their smelle disleeke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eat Onyons, and you shall not smelle the leeke;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you of Onyons would the scente expelle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eat Garlicke, that shall drowne the Onyon’s Smelle.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>I would not go quite as far as the poet, but
I confess to a weakness for chives. A judicious
touch to many salads and made dishes
is very desirable. Chives are to onions as
the sucking-pig is to pork, a baby scent, a
fairy titillation, an echo of the great Might
Be.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb had a friend who said that a
man cannot have a pure mind who refuses
apple dumplings. In the plural, mind you,
not the singular. Appetites have vastly
changed since then, probably not for the
better, but the test even to-day seems adequate
and noteworthy. I do not propose to
recommend either onions or apple dumplings
as Chafing-Dish experiments, but merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
adduce them as worthy examples of the
toothsomeness of simplicity.</p>

<p>The late lamented Joseph, of the Savoy
and elsewhere, once said in his wisdom,
“Make the good things as plain as possible.
God gave a special flavour to everything.
Respect it. Do not destroy it by messing.”
These are winged words, and should be inscribed
(in sugar icing) above the hearthstone
of every artist in pots and pans.</p>

<p>The Chafing Dish is a veritable Mephistopheles
in the way of temptation. It is so
alluringly easy to add just a taste of this or
that, a few drops of sauce, a sprinkling of
herbs, a suggestion of something else. But
beware and perpend! Do not permit your
culinary perspective to become too Japanesque
in the matter of foreground. Remember
your <i>chiaroscuro</i>, take care of the middle
distance, and let the background assert its importance
in the whole composition. “I can
resist anything—except temptation” is the
cry of the hopelessly weak in culinary
morality.</p>

<p>Lest I should be hereafter accused of contradicting
my own most cherished beliefs, let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
me hasten here and now to assert that condiments,
esoteric and otherwise, were undoubtedly
made to be used as well as to be
sold; and I am no enemy of bolstering up
the weak and assimilative character of—say—veal,
“the chameleon of the kitchen,” with
something stronger, and, generally speaking,
of making discreet use of suave subtleties to
give completeness to the picture. But the
watchword must always be Discretion! To
those who muddle their flavours I would
commend the words of the Archbishop in
Gil Blas: “My son, I wish you all manner
of prosperity—and a little more taste!”</p>

<p>Sidney Smith thought Heaven must be a
place where you ate <i>pâté de foies gras</i> to the
sound of trumpets. There is a late Georgian
ingenuousness about this which is refreshing.
The liver of the murdered goose and the
scarlet sound of brass! Nowadays a Queen’s
Hall gourmet would compare the celestial
regions to a continuous feast of <i>Cailles de
Vigne braisées à la Parisienne</i> to the accompaniment
of Tschaikowsky’s “Casse Noisette”
suite, which is more complicated, but perchance
not less indigestible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The typical crude British cookery, if carelessly
performed, is a constant menace to its
disciples. If well cooked there is nothing
more wholesome, save perhaps the French
<i>cuisine bourgeoise</i>, but—“much virtue in your
If.” As a matter of fact, in nine households
out of ten, in the middle-middle classes (and
the upper too) the fare is well-intentioned in
design, but deadly in execution, with a total
absence of care and taste.</p>

<p>There is a curious old book, probably out
of print nowadays, which deals tenderly, if
severely, with the shortcomings of British
cookery. It was published in 1853, and is
called “Memoirs of a Stomach, written by
Himself.” A typical passage runs: “The
English system of cookery it would be impertinent
of me to describe; but still, when I
think of that huge round of parboiled ox-flesh,
with sodden dumplings floating in a
saline, greasy mixture, surrounded by carrots,
looking red with disgust, and turnips pale
with dismay, I cannot help a sort of inward
shudder, and making comparisons unfavourable
to English gastronomy.”</p>

<p>This is fair comment, and brings me back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to the advantages of the Chafing Dish. An
old German fairy tale, I think one of
Grimm’s, says: “Nothing tastes so nice as
what one eats oneself,” and it is certain that
if one cooks so as entirely to satisfy oneself
(always supposing oneself to be a person of
average good taste), then one’s guests will be
equally satisfied—if not more so.</p>

<p>In dealing with Chaffinda we may, after a
minimum of practice, be almost certain of
results. If one is naturally clean, neat and
dainty in one’s tastes, then one’s cooking
should display the same characteristics. One’s
individuality shines forth in the Chafing
Dish and is reflected in one’s sauces. Chaffinda
conveys a great moral lesson, and, as
a teacher, should not lack in honour and
reverence.</p>

<p>The late Prince Consort, being on a visit,
wrote to a friend: “Things always taste so
much better in small houses”; if one substitutes
small dishes for small houses the
Prince predicted the Chafing Dish.</p>

<p>The kitchen is the country in which there
are always discoveries to be made, and with
Chaffinda on a neat white tablecloth before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
one, half a dozen little dishes with food in
various stages of preparation, a few select
condiments, an assortment of wooden spoons
and like utensils—and an inventive brain—there
are absolutely no limits to one’s discoveries.
One is bound by no rule, no law,
no formula, save those of ordinary common
sense, and though it might be too much to
expect to rediscover the lost Javanese recipe
for cooking kingfishers’ or halcyons’ nests,
the old manner of treating a Hocco, or the
true inwardness of “the dish called Maupygernon”;
yet there are illimitable possibilities
which act as incentives to the enterprising.</p>

<p>There is a Chinese proverb to the effect
that most men dig their graves with their
teeth, meaning thereby that we all eat too
much. This is awfully true and sad and
undeniable, and avoidable. The late Lord
Playfair asserted that the actual requirements
of a healthy man for a seven-day week were
three pounds of meat, one pound of fat, two
loaves of bread, one ounce of salt, and five
pints of milk. What a contrast to the chop-eating,
joint-chewing, plethoric individual
who averages five meals a day, and does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
justice to them all! Sir Henry Thompson
says: “The doctors all tell us we eat too
fast, and too often, and too much, and too
early, and too late; but no one of them ever
says that we eat too little.”</p>

<p>The proper appreciation of Chaffinda may
ameliorate this, for in using her one speedily
becomes convinced of the beauty of small
portions, an appetite kept well in hand,
and the manifold advantages of moderation.
It is easy to feed, but nice eating
is an art.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilberforce knew a greedy clergyman
who, when asked to say grace before
dinner, was wont to look whether there were
champagne glasses on the table. If there
were, he began: “Bountiful Jehovah”; but
if he only espied claret glasses he contented
himself with: “We are not worthy of the
least of Thy mercies.”</p>

<p>Of course growing children and quite young
grown-up folks require proportionately more
food than real adults, for they have not only
to maintain but to build up their bodies.
But to such the Chafing Dish will not appeal
primarily, if at all, and they may even be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
found impertinent enough to look upon it as
a culinary joke, which it is not.</p>

<p>Chaffinda hates gluttons, but takes pleasure
in ministering to the modest wants of the
discerning acolyte, fostering his incipient
talent, urging him to higher flights, and
tempting him to delicate fantasies.</p>

<p>“Do have some more; it isn’t very good,
but there’s lots of it.” So said a friend of
mine to his guests about his half-crown port.
This is the sentiment of the man who knows
not the Chafing Dish. “Lots of it” is the
worst kind of hospitality, and suggests the
quantity, not quality, of the cheap-jack kerbstone
butcher. Little and good, and enough
to go round, is the motto of the tactful house-husband.
A French cook once said that it
was only unlucky to sit down thirteen at
table if the food were but sufficient for
twelve.</p>

<p>There is such a deal of fine confused feeding
about the ordinary meals of even a simply
conducted country house that imagination
boggles at the thought of the elaboration of
the daily menus. With four, or possibly
five, repasts a day, few of them chaste, most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of them complicated, a careful observer will
note that the cook has been listening to the
pipings of the Great God Sauce, and covers
natural flavours with misnamed concoctions
which do nothing but obliterate nature and
vex the palate.</p>

<p>There are some few houses, great and
small, town and country, where the elemental
decencies of the kitchen are manfully preserved,
where wholesome mutton does not
masquerade as <i>Quartier d’Agneau à la Miséricorde</i>,
and the toothsome lobster is not
Americanised out of all knowing. To such
establishments, all honour and glory.</p>

<p>But to those whose means or opportunities
do not permit of a carefully trained cook, a
home-made artist, I would in all diffidence
recommend the cult of the Chafing Dish,
whose practical use I now propose to discuss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Chaffinda’s</span> cooking battery is small, but
select. The Chafing Dish proper comprises
the stand and lamp, and the dish, called
the “Blazer,” which has an ebony handle;
and there is an ingenious spirit diminisher
which enables one to reduce the flame to a
minimum, just enough to keep the flame
simmering, or to put it out altogether. A
second, or hot water pan, belongs to the outfit,
and an asbestos toast-making tray may be
bought for a trifle. In addition, a couple
of green or brown dishes of French fireproof
china, an egg-poacher, a marmite, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
perhaps a casserole, all of which are best from
Bonnet in Church Street, Soho, will come in
very usefully. To these may be added the
usual complement of plates and dishes and
several wooden spoons of different sizes; a
fish-lifter is also desirable, so is a strainer, and
a pair of graters come in very handily. This
practically completes the gear of the budding
Chafist, though additional items may be added
from time to time as occasion demands.</p>

<p>The makers of the Chafing Dish sell a
useful methylated spirit can, with a curved
spout to fill up the asbestos wick. It will be
found that a good filling will burn for thirty
to forty minutes, which is ample for all
ordinary purposes. Much of course depends
on the quality of the spirit used, and, further,
the wick will only become thoroughly
saturated after half a dozen usings, and will
subsequently require rather less spirit. I
have found that water boils in the “Blazer,”
or handled Chafing Dish, in about ten
minutes, and instructions on bottled or preserved
food, soups and the like, must be
slightly discounted. Thus if one is told to
boil for twenty minutes, it will be found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
fifteen minutes in the Chafing Dish will be
ample in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>As this is mainly a true story of my own
personal adventures among the pots and
pans, I can hardly do better than describe the
first dish I tried my ’prentice hand upon, with
the devout wish that all neophytes may be as
successful therewith as I was.</p>


<p class="sec">Beef Strips.</p>

<p>The experiment, the preliminary exercise,
if I may so term it, has no name, although it
savours somewhat of the Resurrection Pie,
unbeloved of schoolboys. Let us call it
Beef Strips. Cut three thick slices from a
rather well-cooked cold sirloin of beef, cut
these again into strips a quarter of an inch
wide and about three inches long. Take
care that they are very lean. Chop up half
a dozen cold boiled potatoes (not of the
floury kind) into dice. Put the beef and the
potatoes into the Chafing Dish. Light the
lamp and see that the heat is steady, but not
too strong. Add at once a good-sized walnut
of butter, a teaspoon of Worcester sauce, salt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and pepper. For at least ten minutes turn
over the mixture continually with a wooden
spoon until it is thoroughly heated. Turn it
out on to a hot dish, and garnish with half a
dozen tiny triangles of toast.</p>

<p>This is a simple luncheon or supper dish
which takes little time, and—to my taste at
least—is appetising and satisfying. Like all
Chafing-Dish preparations, it can be cooked
on the table, with no more protection than
a tray under the wrought-iron stand, and a
square of coloured tablecloth upon your
white one to receive possible splashes or
drops.</p>


<p class="sec">Jellied Ham.</p>

<p>Now for exercise number two, which I
have christened Jellied Ham, and commend
as a dish very unlikely to go wrong in the
manipulation.</p>

<p>Get your flame steady and true, and put a
small walnut of butter in the dish. When it
is fluid, add a good dessert-spoonful of red
currant jelly, a liqueur glass of sherry, and
three drops of Tabasco sauce. Drop into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
this simmering mixture a few slices of cold
boiled ham cut thin and lean, and let it
slowly cook for six to eight minutes. If you
wish to be extravagant, then instead of the
sherry use a full wine-glassful of champagne.
It is by no means necessary to eat this with
vegetables, but if you insist on the conjunction,
I would recommend a purée of
spinach, directions for which appear hereafter.</p>

<p>This Jellied Ham is an agreeable concoction,
which I find peculiarly soothing as a
light supper after having seen an actor-manager
playing Shakespeare. This is, however,
after all only a matter of taste.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that different
forms of the drama require, nay demand,
different dinners and suppers, according to
the disposition in which one approaches them.
For instance, before an Adelphi melodrama,
turtle soup (mock if necessary), turbot and
rump steaks are indicated, whereas a musical
comedy calls for an East Room menu, and
an Ibsen or G. B. Shaw play for an A.B.C.
shop or a vegetarian restaurant respectively.
But I only hint at the broad outline of my idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
which is capable of extension to an indefinite
limit.</p>

<p>Vegetarian meals do not appeal to me.
There is a sense of sudden and temporary
repletion followed shortly afterwards by an
aching void, which can only be assuaged by
a period of comparatively gross feeding.
Besides, judging from the appearance of my
vegetarian friends (in whom maybe I am
unfortunate) they often seem so much to
resemble some of the foods they eat as to
render themselves liable to be dubbed cannibals.
But this is probably mere prejudice.</p>


<p class="sec">Minced Chicken or Game.</p>

<p>To resume the cult of Chaffinda. Here is
another dish which I recommend to the beginner.
It is a simple mince. Take any
remains of chicken or game, pheasant for
choice, and mince it (or have it minced)
small, but not too small. Never use a mincing
machine. Put the mince aside, and mix
in the Chafing Dish the following sauce: a
full walnut of butter, a tablespoon of flour,
and a pinch of salt and pepper; add gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
about a tumblerful of milk. Keep continually
stirring this and cook it well for five
minutes, adding three drops of Tabasco sauce
and half a tablespoon of Worcester sauce,
also a squeeze of a lemon. When it is
thoroughly amalgamated throw in the mince
and let it get hot without burning. Serve it
with toast or very crisp biscuits.</p>

<p>The only objection I know to this mince
is that all cold birds, especially cold pheasant,
are so excellent that it seems almost superfluous
to hot them up. But there are
occasions when the gamey fumes from Chaffinda
are very alluring, and, after all, it is poor
work eating cold cates at midnight, however
tempting they might be at breakfast.</p>

<p>Our forebears were unanimous in their
praise of the lordly long-tail. In a letter
from Sidney Smith to “Ingoldsby” Barham,
the worthy cleric says: “Many thanks, my
dear Sir, for your kind present of game. If
there is a pure and elevated pleasure in this
world, it is that of roast pheasant and bread
sauce; barndoor fowls for Dissenters, but for
the Real Churchman, the Thirty-Nine times
articled clerk, the pheasant! the pheasant!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Toast.</p>

<p>It should perhaps be mentioned that the
making of toast on the Chafing Dish is the
easiest of functions. The asbestos tray, already
referred to, is placed over the flame,
and on the metal side the bread in rounds,
triangles, or sippets; a few minutes serve to
toast the one side adequately, and on being
turned over it can easily be browned through.
Mrs. Beeton is loquacious on the art of toast-making,
and lays down divers rules, but she
knew not Chaffinda. A modern essayist who
discourses learnedly and most sensibly on
toast, makes a remark in his chapter on
breakfasts, which although not entirely germane
to my subject, is so true and, to my
thinking, so characteristic, that I cannot refrain
from quoting it. He is referring to marmalade.
“The attitude of women to marmalade,”
he says, “has never been quite sound.
True, they make it excellently, but afterwards
their association with it is one lamentable
retrogression. They spread it over pastry;
they do not particularly desire it at breakfast;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and (worst) they decant it into glass dishes
and fancy jars.”</p>

<p>How true, how profound, how typical!</p>

<p>But this is wandering from the point, which
is cookery, not casuistry. Women are never
out of place in connection with the good
things of the table, although they do not
often aspire to the omni-usefulness of the
well-meaning, if ill-educated, lady who
applied for the position of nurse to one of the
field hospitals during the Boer war, and mentioned
as her crowning qualification that,
“like Cæsar’s wife, I am all things to all men.”</p>


<p class="sec">Mutton Cutlets.</p>

<p>After this little digression it will be well to
turn to more serious things—cutlets, for
instance. Obtain from the butcher a couple
of well-trimmed mutton cutlets, and from the
greengrocer sufficient green peas that, when
shelled, you will have a breakfast-cupful.
Melt a walnut of butter in the Chafing Dish.
Into the melted butter drop a tablespoonful
of flour and a sprinkling of chopped chives.
A teaspoonful of Worcester sauce and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
drops of Tabasco, together with salt at discretion,
will suffice for flavouring, and care
must be taken that the mixture does not boil.
Put in the cutlets, and when they begin to
turn brownish add the peas, and half a cupful
of milk. About fifteen minutes should cook
the meat through if your spirit flame be
strong, otherwise it may take somewhat
longer. A very good substitute for Worcester
sauce, in this connection, is Sauce Robert,
which it is unnecessary to manufacture, as it
can be bought ready made, and well made
too, of the Escoffier brand. With certain
meats it is an excellent condiment.</p>

<p>By the way, in some very old cookery
books Sauce Robert was termed Roe-Boat
sauce, an extraordinary orthographic muddle.
An omelette was likewise known as a
“Hamlet.”</p>

<p>This suggests the somewhat too sophisticated
schoolboy’s description of Esau as “a
hairy, humpbacked man, who wrote a book of
fables and sold the copyright for a bottle of
potash.”</p>

<p>It may be deemed superfluous, and in that
case I apologise beforehand, to insist on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
most scrupulous cleanliness in dealing with
the Chafing Dish and its adjuncts. Not only
should the dish itself be kept spotless and
thoroughly scoured, but the stand, the lamp,
the implements, and the glass and china
should be immaculate. Servants are easily
persuaded to look after the cleaning process,
and do it with a certain amount of care, but
it can do no harm to understudy their duties
and add an extra polish all round oneself. It
gives one, too, a personal interest in the
result, otherwise lacking. I recommend the
use of at least three dishcloths, which should
be washed regularly and used discreetly. The
Chafist who neglects his apparatus is unworthy
of the high mission with which he is
charged, and deserves the appellation of the
younger son of Archidamus III., King of
Sparta. Cleanliness is next to all manner of
things in this dusty world of ours, and absolutely
nothing conduces more to the enjoyment
of a mealet that one has cooked oneself
than the knowledge that everything is spick
and span, and that one has contributed oneself
thereto by a little extra care and forethought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>A word of warning here. Never use
“kitchen butter,” or “kitchen sherry,” or
“kitchen eggs,” or “kitchen” anything else;
use the very best you can afford.</p>

<p>An armoury of brooms, brushes, scrubbers,
soap and soda is in no way necessary. A
couple of polishing cloths and a little, a very
little, of one of the many patent cleaners is
all that is required. A clear conscience and
plenty of elbow-grease does the rest.</p>

<p>The British equivalent of the continental
<i>charcutier</i> is of inestimable service to the
Chafist. At his more or less appetising
emporium, small quantities of edibles can be
purchased which are excellently well adapted
for the cult of Chaffinda, especially if one be
inclined towards the recooking of cold meats,
instead of the treatment of them in a raw
state. Both have their advantages—and their
drawbacks. It is a general, but totally inaccurate,
belief that meat once cooked needs
only to be hotted up again. Nothing could
be more fatal to its flavour and nutriment.
A certain amount of the good juices of the
meat must inevitably have been lost during
the first process, and therefore great care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
must be taken in the second operation to
tempt forth, and, in some cases, to restore
the natural flavour. Cold cooked meat needs
long and gentle cooking, a strong clear flame,
without sudden differences in temperature,
and it may be taken as a general rule that
cold meat needs practically as long to cook as
raw meat.</p>


<p class="sec">Browned Tongue.</p>

<p>For example, take half a dozen slices of
cooked tongue, spread on each of them a
modicum of made mustard, and let each
slice repose for about two minutes in a little
bath of salad oil (about enough to cover the
bottom of a soup plate). Put the slices one
on top of another until they make a compact
little heap. Put the heap of tongue between
two plates, so as to expel the superfluous oil.
Let it remain thus for half an hour. Then
put a nutmeg of butter in the blazer, dismember
the heap of tongue, and put the
slices into the frizzling butter and turn them
until they are brown. A little sauce, Worcester,
Robert, or Piquant, may be added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
suit individual taste. Serve very hot, with
sippets of toast.</p>

<p>I have ventured to christen this dish
<i>Browned Tongue</i>, which is simple and descriptive,
but every Chafist is entitled to call it
what he likes. There is little, if any,
copyright in Chafing-Dish titles. Alexandre
Dumas, author and cook, protests against the
mishandling of names: “Les fantaisies de
saucer, de mettre sur le gril, et de faire rôtir
nos grands hommes.”</p>

<p>Personally I object to cooking simple fare
and then dubbing it <i>à la Quelque chose</i>. Outside
the few score well-known, and, so to say,
classic titles of more or less elaborate dishes,
which are practically standardised, there seems
to me to be no reason to invent riddles in
nomenclature when the “short title,” as they
say in Parliamentary Bills, is amply descriptive.</p>

<p>It has been my ill-fortune to be introduced,
at an otherwise harmless suburban dinner, to
a catastrophe of cutlets, garnished with
tinned vegetables, and to be gravely informed,
on an ill-spelt menu, that it was “<i>Cutelletes
d’Agneau à la Jardinnier</i>,” which would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
ludicrous, were it not sad. Then how often
does the kind hostess, without a punitive
thought in her composition, write down
<i>Soufflet</i> when she means <i>Soufflé</i>?</p>

<p>But mistakes are easily made, as witness
that popular sign of a French cabaret, particularly
in the provinces, <i>Au Lion d’Or</i>. If you
look carefully at the signboard, you will find
a man asleep, the punning name of the hotel
implying <i>Au lit on dort</i>.</p>

<p>But the whole question of Menus (Bills of
Fare, if you please), and their mistranslation,
is too vast to enter upon here, alluring though
the subject may be. The language of the
restaurant cook, save in especial instances, is
as bad, although in a quite different sense, as
that of the Whitechapel Hooligan. At the
same time, it is absurd to insist upon the
literal translation of the untranslatable.
“Out of works” for “Hors d’œuvres”;
“Soup at the good woman” for “Potage à
la bonne femme”; “Smile of a calf at the
banker’s wife” for “Ris de veau à la financière”;
and, lastly, “Anchovies on the sofa”
for “Anchois sur canapé,” are all well enough
in their way, but hardly an example to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
followed, although they make “very pretty
patriotic eating.”</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous to run away with
the idea that because certain folk misuse the
language, French should be henceforward
taboo at our dinner-tables. Such a notion is
ignorant and impossible. But the Gallic
tongue should be used with discretion and
knowledge, and if the enterprising Chafist
invent a new dish of eggs, there is no law to
forbid his naming it <i>Œufs à la Temple du
Milieu</i>. It would only show the quality of
his erudition and his taste. There seems no
particular reason why we should not replace
<i>Rôti</i> by Roast, <i>Entrée</i> by Remove, and
<i>Entremet</i> by Sweet—except that it is not
done; it is an affectation of humbug, of
course, but the greatest humbug of all humbugs
is the pretending to despise humbug.</p>


<p class="sec">Alderman’s Walk.</p>

<p><i>On revient toujours à son premier mouton</i>—that
is to say, let us get back to Chaffinda. The
next dish on the experimental programme is
“The Alderman’s Walk,” a very old English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
delicacy, the most exquisite portion of the
most exquisite joint in Cookerydom, and
so called because, at City dinners of our
grandfathers’ times, it is alleged to have been
reserved for the Aldermen. It is none other
than the first, longest and juiciest longitudinal
slice, next to the bone, of a succulent saddle
of mutton, Southdown for choice, and four
years old at that, though this age is rare.
Remove this slice tenderly and with due
reverence from the hot joint, lay it aside on
a slice of bread, its own length, and let it get
cold, thoroughly cold. Then prepare in the
Chafing Dish a sauce composed of a walnut
of butter, a teaspoon of Worcester, three
drops of Tabasco, three chopped chives, and
an eggspoon of made mustard. Stir these
ingredients until the amalgamation is smooth
and complete. Then take the bread, which
should have absorbed a good deal of the juice
from under the Alderman’s Walk, cut it into
strips, and lightly toast the strips. Drop the
meat into the sauce, and let it cook for eight
minutes, turning it once, that is, four minutes
for each side. Slide it out on to a hot dish,
put the toast round it, eat it in a hurry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
thank your stars that you are alive to enjoy
it. This is a dish which has few equals and
no superiors. It is simple, innocent, toothsome,
satisfying, and several other things.</p>

<p>Something like it, but lacking its artistic
severity, may be found in Alexandre Dumas’
Great Dictionary, but it is complicated with
eccentric accessories; there is a turbulent
confused foreground to it which effectually
conceals the mutton, but then, of course, poor
Dumas, although he knew and appreciated,
could rarely obtain the real Southdown.</p>

<p>At the time that the great author was overwhelmed
with commissions for novels, after the
enormous success of “The Three Musketeers”
and other masterpieces, he was commonly
understood to put books in the market which
were written by Auguste Maquet, and merely
signed by himself. Dumas, as is well known,
was a great amateur cook, and in fact prided
himself more on his dishes than on his novels.
One day he invited the famous Aurelien Scholl
to dinner, and put before him a salmon
mayonnaise which he—Dumas Père—had
made with his own hands. “Taste that,
Scholl,” he said, “and tell me how you
like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Scholl tasted it and made a wry face.
“Really, Dumas,” he replied, “I think it
must be by Maquet.”</p>

<p>Having been thus trained by the recipes
here given, it seems reasonable to suppose
that the Chafist is able, after a profound
study thereof, to appreciate the possibilities of
the Chafing Dish, and may therefore be permitted
to dip as he listeth into the various
recipes which follow, none of which are complicated
or expensive, and most of which
require little, if any, previous preparation.
At the same time I would most earnestly beg
the Chafist carefully to rehearse all his
impromptu effects, and never to leave anything
to chance. Always have your condiments,
your garnishings, your “fixings,” as the
Americans say, ready to hand. Let the
manipulation of the Chafing Dish partake of
that Art which conceals Art—simply because
everything is foreseen, and nothing postponed
till the last moment. Let your parsley be
ready chopped, your toast ready cut, your
lemon duly cleaned, your spare dishes hot and
ready, and, lastly, your apparatus in thorough
working order. You may then proceed in
all good faith and earnestness.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap large">While</span> there’s life there’s soup,” said an
irreverent parodist, but as a matter of fact
the reverse of the proverb would be more
true, for, of a verity, while there’s soup
there’s life. There can be no complaint of
having dined badly, or even insufficiently,
if one has begun with a plateful of good
soup; <i>good</i>, mind you, with some strength
and body to it, for the coloured hot water
that masquerades too often as soup is unworthy
and despicable. But soup that has
character, individuality, and belies not its
name, is to the nice eater almost a meal in
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>There are practically no soups beyond the
scope of the Chafing Dish, albeit some of the
more elaborate <i>bisques</i>, a <i>bouillabaisse</i> (an that
be a soup), and a pink <i>Bortsch</i>, have not come
within my experimental experience. The
ordinary French <i>consommé</i>, which may be
likened to our gravy soup, is practically the
foundation of most clear soups. One meets
on different bills of fare with a score of variations
on the theme, such as Printanier,
Brunoise, Paysanne, Julienne, Mitonnage,
Croûte au Pot, Faubonne, Macédoine, Chiffonade,
Flamande, and many more, but they
are really only a matter of flavouring and
vegetable decoration upon a foundation of
good stock. An old French cookbook,
dated 1822, lies before me, which contains
one hundred and two recipes for soups,
but the first one mentioned, the Potage au
Naturel, is the Mother Soup of all the rest.</p>

<p>The veritable chef has his store of Mother
Soup, and that is his kitchen Stock Exchange
whence practically all his varieties emanate.</p>

<p>The Chafing Dish votary cannot construct
his own Mother Soup and keep up his own
stock-pot, but he can use the many excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
preserved soups, in bottles and boxes, which
nowadays are absolutely equal to those which
are self-manipulated or home-made.</p>

<p>I have tried many brands, and really think
that there is not very much to choose between
them. For ordinary use I lean to the
Maggi preparations, the “Cross-Star Soups.”
They are in tablets, each sufficient for two
persons, and the White Haricots, Onion,
Tapioca, Chervil, Sago, Semolina, Lentil,
Parmentier, Sorrel, Barley, Rice and Julienne
are quite excellent.</p>

<p>The method of procedure is simplicity
itself. The tablet is broken into fragments in
a cup or a bowl and mixed into a thin paste
with a little cold water. Then heat a pint of
water in the Chafer to boiling, pour in the
mixture, and let it cook gently, not boiling,
for fifteen to twenty minutes. Each tablet
has its own particular directions on the
wrapper, and I have found that they apply
equally to the Chafing Dish, except that the
time required is rather shorter than that
mentioned, owing to the greater heat. The
flavour of the soups can be enhanced by a
few drops of sauce, a sprinkling of Paprika<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
pepper, half a wineglass of sherry, or a dash
of Tabasco; but this is a matter of individual
taste. The tapioca, sago, and semolina soups
are particularly good, and I do not find that
they require the addition of any salt, although
this again is a purely personal affair. A
beaten-up raw egg put into the soup and
well stirred up just before serving makes
it richer and suaver, but is by no means
necessary.</p>

<p>By the way, in cooking soups, as indeed in
all Chafing-Dish cookery, I cannot too
earnestly insist upon the use of wooden
spoons for all stirring manipulations. Metal
spoons, even silver, are abhorrent to the
good cook. Wooden spoons are clean, cheap,
and thoroughly efficient. The fancy-dress-ball
cook (“Cordong blew” he generally
calls himself) always wears one in his apron,
but if he only knew it, the wooden spoon
(apart from examination awards) is his surest
title to honour as a true <i>maître de bouche</i>.
The Spanish Estudiantina also wear a wooden
spoon in their black tricorne hats, but this, I
understand, only means that they are poor
and hungry, and glad to dip their spoon in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
any one’s mess of Puchero, in order to enjoy a
square meal.</p>


<p class="sec">Pea Soup.</p>

<p>Pea soup is a great invention. Not the <i>Purée
aux Petits Pois</i> (good as that may be) of the
chefiest of chefs, but the plain, good, thick,
flavoursome pea soup which is as nourishing
as it is soothing and satisfying. I find that
Chaffinda’s favourite is Brand’s Consolidated
Pea Soup, which sounds like a gold mine, but
is really a sort of <i>Erbswurst</i>, only better. It
is sold in dainty little tins at an absurdly cheap
price. One little tin makes two good platesful.
It is prepared by mixing the contents to
a thick paste with water. To this paste add
a pint of cold water, put it all in the Chafing
Dish, and boil it for about twelve to fifteen
minutes until it gets thick. To make it even
better, add a sprinkling of dried mint and a
handful of toast dice, browned with butter,
and you have a feast for hungry gods on a
cold day.</p>

<p>Another way: instead of using mint and
toast, cut half a dozen thin slices from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Brunswick sausage, peel off the rind and drop
them in the soup when it is half cooked. The
mixture is very toothsome.</p>


<p class="sec">Turtle Soup.</p>

<p>From small things to great: from the
common and strictly garden pea to the Aldermanic
and luscious turtle. Most turtle importers
make their own preserved turtle,
which is sometimes good and always expensive.
For Chafing-Dish purposes I prefer the Concrete
Turtle Tablets made by Levien and
Sherlock, of 68 Harbour Street, Kingston,
Jamaica. They are to be had at the Army
and Navy Stores. Each little cake is enough
for two moderately greedy people, and costs
one shilling.</p>

<p>Put in the Chafing Dish a good pint of
water, which bring to the boil; add salt and
pepper (Paprika for choice) to taste. Cut
the turtle tablet into pieces, or if it is too
hard, as is often the case in winter, break it
up into eight or ten lumps. Throw these
into the boiling water and keep on stirring
until they dissolve and the soup becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
clear. This takes some little time, but it is
worth waiting for. Add a squeeze of lemon
juice, a wine-glass of sherry, and a teaspoon
of Worcester sauce. Give a final stir to these
ingredients, and serve it up steaming hot.</p>

<p>There is extraordinary reviving power about
a basin of good turtle soup, and, as I think I
have shown, it is quite a mistake to deem it an
expensive luxury. Abraham Hayward, Q.C.,
in his inimitable book, “The Art of Dining,”
which were originally <i>Quarterly Review</i>
articles on Police Magistrate Walker’s
“Original” (1835), says that “Turtle Soup
from Painter’s in Leadenhall Street is decidedly
the best thing in the shape of soup
that can be had in this or perhaps in any
other country.” And if an Alderman, a
Queen’s Counsel, a Police Magistrate—and
Chaffinda—agree on this point, who shall say
them nay?</p>

<p>The student of mid-Victorian ballads will
remember, too, the touching allusion to turtle
soup in “Ferdinando and Elvira,” by one
Bab, where the hero searches for the cracker-motto
poet, and at last unearths him at a confectioner’s
where he has ordered soup:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Found at last!’ I madly shouted. ‘Gentle<br> pieman, you astound me!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I waved the turtle soup enthusiastically<br> round me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>But this was, on reflection, probably mock
turtle soup, no bad thing either, <i>vide</i> Alice’s
interview with the Gryphon. It lives, when
cold, in a basin, and is set hard and is therefore
wavable.</p>

<p>American soups are not to be despised.
On the contrary, they make most excellent good
eating—or drinking; which is it? do we eat
or drink soup? An American book of
etiquette says, “Never chew your soup,
always swallow it whole.”</p>

<p>Anyhow I have tried, and found good, Clam
Chowder, Clam Broth, Chicken Gumbo, Okra,
Terrapin, and Vegetable Soups. They are in
tins, against which I confess I am prejudiced,
but as yet I am totally unpoisoned, and I am
told that there is a possibility of their being
shortly put up in bottles. Each tin has full
instructions, and these are quite applicable to
the Chafing Dish, care always being taken not
to boil the soup, but to heat it gently and
continuously. The Clam Chowder and Clam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Broth are both quite excellent, of a distinct
individual flavour, cheering, and, I opine,
wholesome. They have a peculiar <i>cachet</i> of
their own, and lend a certain Transatlantic
originality to an otherwise banal Chafing-Dish
luncheon.</p>

<p>These and other American provisions I
procure from Jackson’s in Piccadilly. They
are well “packed,” and adapt themselves
excellently to unexpected calls on a limited
larder. Their variety is infinite, and their
flavour remains good and true. Tinned
Broadway in London is a pleasant experience.
There are other American delicacies, to
which reference will be made in due
course, which adapt themselves admirably
to Chafing-Dish idiosyncrasies. Columbus’
patent egg is not the only culinary innovation
from the New World, but the average
British cook is so ignorantly conservative
and abhorrently Chauvinistic that she dreads
novelty as she dreads the Devil.</p>


<p class="sec">Poor Man’s Soup.</p>

<p>Poor Man’s Soup, as the French call it, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
a very restorative dish after a bad day on the
Stock Exchange, although there is little of
the Poor Man about it save the name.</p>

<p>Put a finely-shredded onion and a walnut
of butter in the Chafing Dish and fry to a
light brown colour, then add a heaped teaspoonful
of flour and stir well; pour in a
pint of stock, add pepper and salt to taste.
Peel and slice a potato and scatter it in the
soup; let the mixture come to a boil, and
then allow it to simmer for ten minutes.
Just before serving stir into it the yolk of an
egg, well beaten up, and a dozen sippets of
dry toast. This is a soothing and easy soup,
but it requires the stockpot, unless you make
use of one of the many varieties of concentrated
bouillon or beef-tea, which certainly
save a lot of trouble.</p>


<p class="sec">Palestine Soup.</p>

<p>Another simple soup, which moreover has
the advantage of not requiring stock, is
Palestine or Jerusalem Artichoke soup. By
the way, we misname this vegetable strangely.
It was imported into Great Britain from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Italy, and being the tuber of a variety of
sunflower, is there termed <i>Girasole</i>, because
the flower turns to the sun. We, in our
insular ignorance, corrupted <i>Girasole</i> to
<i>Jerusalem</i>, and then, wishing to refine the
latter word, committed a further solecism by
calling the soup made therefrom <i>Palestine</i>
soup. Could any little exercise in culinary etymology
be more ridiculous, or more typical?</p>

<p>Pick out six good-sized Jerusalem artichokes,
boil them in the Chafing Dish with a
pinch of salt; when quite soft, put them
through a fine sieve and place the extract on
one side. Then put a pint of milk in the
dish and boil it with a teaspoonful of Paprika
pepper, two cloves and a dash of nutmeg, and
a couple of sprigs of parsley. Let it boil up
for a minute and then strain it, and also put
it aside. Melt a walnut of butter in the dish
and stir into it a dessert-spoonful of corn-flour,
to which add the strained milk, and,
lastly, the artichoke extract, keeping the spirit-lamp
flame low, so that the mixture shall not
boil. When it has simmered for five minutes
and become thoroughly amalgamated the
soup is ready to serve, and very good it is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
or ought to be, if the cooking has been
artfully and carefully carried out.</p>


<p class="sec">Creçy (Carrot) Soup.</p>

<p>Carrot Soup is not only excessively nice
and nourishing, but it has also a curious
historical interest. The best French carrots
come from the neighbourhood of Creçy, and
Carrot Soup is therefore generally known as
Creçy Soup. Now the famous battle of that
name, where Edward the Black Prince won
his three-feather badge and motto of <i>Ich
Dien</i>, was fought on Saturday, August 26,
1346, and Court gossip relates that to this
day the Prince of Wales has Creçy Soup for
dinner every 26th of August. I am unable
to verify the statement, but trust that it may
be true; anyway it is a pretty fable.</p>

<p>To make Carrot Soup, cut up three or
four fair-sized carrots into thin round slices,
put them in the Chafing Dish with a wineglass
of sherry, two cloves, a sprinkling of
nutmeg, and a good bunch of parsley; pour
over it a cupful of stock and let it nearly
boil, but not quite. When the carrots are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
quite soft and almost pulpy, mash them well
in a soup-plate and, discarding anything hard
in the mixture, replace it in the Chafer with
two more cups of stock, a teaspoon of sugar,
and just before it boils drop in a walnut of
butter, and take it off the flame. Toasted
dice are the usual accompaniment, and the
soup, if well concocted, is very hard to beat
for honest, toothsome fare.</p>

<p>The menus of three Buckingham Palace
dinners tell me that his Majesty the King
partook of Bisque d’Ecrevisse on May 30,
1902, of Clear Turtle or Cold Consommé on
June 2, and of Consommé Riche on June 13.
The second of these quotations is from the
interesting programme of the fare offered to
the members of the Jockey Club at the
King’s Derby Dinner, one item of which was
Cassolettes à la Jockey Club, presumably a
creation of his Majesty’s chef, Monsieur
Ménager.</p>

<p>President Loubet was less lucky when he
went on his visit to Algiers in April 1903.
After a review of ten thousand native horsemen
at Krieder, he was tendered a native
banquet by the chiefs, which began with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Locust Soup. But even this is not so unappetising
as the recipe of a Monsieur Dagin,
an entomologist, for Cockroach Soup. It is
made thus: “Pound your cockroaches in a
mortar; put them in a sieve and pour in
boiling water or beef-stock. Connoisseurs
prefer this to real bisque.” Possibly; but I
do not recommend it for the Chafing Dish.</p>

<p>On the other hand, real bird’s-nest soup is
a great luxury. As Consommé aux Nids
d’Hirondelles it occasionally appears on a
menu; and the Chinese, I understand, call it
Yen-War-Gung. There is a subtle taste of
the sea in the gelatinous lining of the swallow’s
nest, which is exquisite and delicate. The
Japanese make a soup from black seaweed,
but I cannot speak of it from experience.
There lies before me a curious Latin menu
of a feast given by, or to, certain German
professors whose culinary Latin seems to me
to be a trifle canine. Two lines of it read
“Sorbitio cum globulis jecoralibus et lucanicis,”
and “Jus et Unguis bovinis factum
cum panificio.” These I take to mean liver
soup with sausage, and ox-tongue soup
with bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>But esoteric food-stuffs are more interesting
for their quaintness than for any intrinsic
merit, and I prefer to turn to the degustation
of a Potage Germiny, for instance. This
is the invention of the great Casimir, of the
Maison d’Or, who has placed it on record
that “the happiest day of my life was the
day on which I invented the Potage Germiny.
It is made of sorrel, the yolks of
eggs, and cream. It was for a dinner given
by the Marquis de Saint-Georges, the author
of ‘Les Mousquetaires de la Reine.’ I had
racked my brains to discover something
wonderful, unique; and finally I evolved the
potage. When the Marquis had tasted it
he sent for me. I never saw a man more
moved. He threw his arms around me
and exclaimed in unutterable accents:
‘Casimir, this is not a soup; it is a masterpiece!’”</p>

<p>This is a veritable human document.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror had a cook called
Tezelin, who one day served him with a
white soup called Dillegrout. His Majesty
was so pleased that he made Tezelin Lord
of the Manor of Addington. Good cooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
were appreciated thenadays. But we have
lost the recipe for Dillegrout.</p>

<p>Attempts have often been made to cook
according to ancient recipes, but rarely with
success. The curious in these matters may
be referred to Smollett’s observations in
“Peregrine Pickle” on certain experiments
to cook practically according to the recipes
of Apicius. They ended disastrously.</p>

<p>A last word on soup. The French <i>cuisine
bourgeoise</i> (the best in the world) believes
in good strong meat for its soups, and not,
as we erroneously suppose, makes shift—and
good shift too—out of any odds and ends;
“any old thing,” as the Americans say. On
the contrary, <i>pour faire sourire le pot-au-feu</i>
(delightful expression!) you must have good
material, and plenty of it.</p>

<p>“In a restaurant, when a waiter offers you turbot,
ask for salmon, and when he offers you a sole,
order a mackerel; as language to man, so fish
has been given to the waiter to disguise his
thoughts.”—<span class="smcap">P. Z. Didsbury.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> fish of Great Britain is, beyond all
manner of doubt, the very best in the world.
It is, therefore, only right and proper that
its original flavour should be preserved by
simply boiling or frying it, and eating it with
what some of the old cook-books call its
“Analogies,” which presumably means its
traditional accompaniments: lemon, brown
bread and butter, and so much as may be
of its own liquor, or a Court Bouillon of
the simplest. There are so many ways of
spoiling fish that the Chafer can never go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
far wrong if he rejects all but the most
primitive, although it is not necessary to
revert to the aboriginal braising upon the
hot ashes of a nearly extinct wood fire,
without the intervention of any implement
of stone or earthenware whatever. This
method is, however, still in practice to-day
in many parts of Portugal (and possibly
elsewhere) before the doors of the houses
of the wage-earners, and in the taverns of
the commoner folks.</p>

<p>Without going to extremes, there is a
decent self-respecting kind of cookery, to the
value and charm of which the great Carême
refers in his “Cuisinier Français” (1828),
and which he calls, appropriately enough, <i>le
genre mâle et élégant</i>.</p>

<p>The genius of Carême, however, occasionally
led him to a state of self-appreciation
which is supreme in its bathos. He says,
for instance, in a kind of retrospect of his
contributions to the culinary art: “I contemplated
from behind my ovens the kitchens
of India, China, Egypt, Greece, Turkey,
Italy, Germany and Switzerland, and I felt
their ignoble fabric of routine crumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
under my critical blows.” These are, indeed,
“prave ’orts!”</p>

<p>Herrings are extraordinarily healthy—and
cheap. They are caught by the million—who
also eat them; and whether fresh or
dried, raw or salted, they are one of Nature’s
delicacies. Fresh herrings offer the largest
amount of nutriment for one penny of any
kind of animal food. A fresh herring
weighing 4½ ozs. contains 240 grains of
carbon and 36 grains of nitrogen; and a
dried herring weighing 3 oz. contains 269
grains of carbon and 41 grains of nitrogen.
It is obvious by this what smoking will
do by decreasing weight and increasing
nutriment.</p>

<p>Red herrings are by no means to be
despised, though it is a mistake to imagine
that they are caught in a state of redness.
In that fine old book, “The Yarmouth
Fisherman,” which is not much read nowadays,
piscator says to the tourist: “Sir, we
lay ourselves out to oblige all the gents that
come from London, but we cannot make a
red herring swim.”</p>

<p>Thereanent is a quaint signboard outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the Schifferhaus in the old Hanseatic town
of Lübeck, one of the most beautiful taverns
in the world, and the haunt of old sea-dogs
since the sixteenth century. The signboard
represents a fisherman and two amateurs
angling from a boat; the former has caught
a fine kipper and the latter are looking
supremely disgusted. The legend under the
picture runs: “One Cannot Please Everybody.”</p>

<p>Kippers and their kin have never lacked
admirers, and it is on record that the
Emperor Charles V. made a pilgrimage to
the tomb of the venerable Dutchman who is
supposed to have invented pickled herrings.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Herrings.</p>

<p>To come from herrings in the abstract to
herrings in the concrete, try this in Chaffinda:
Two very fresh herrings, very clean and dry.
Fry them in three tablespoons of oil or two
of butter, with a squeeze of lemon, salt,
pepper, six peppercorns and a tablespoon of
vinegar. After they have cooked for eight
minutes put the fish aside in a hot dish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Then cut a good-sized Spanish onion into
rings, fry these in the oil left by the herrings
till they are of a dark brown colour, taking
great care not to burn them. When ready,
which should be in about six minutes, heap
them round the herrings and serve with
quarters of lemon. This is a lordly dish,
and if properly concocted it leaves you in
that state that you will love all mankind—and
even tolerate the Chinese.</p>

<p>Dean Nowell, or Noel, a clerical Izaak
Walton, and Dean of St. Paul’s (1507-1602)
said that the only thing wrong with the
herring was that it preferred the sea to the
river. The Dean angled much in the Ash
at Hadham; he wrote the Church Catechism,
invented bottled beer (by accident), and
fished for perch and souls. Peace be to
his!</p>

<p>There are as many ways of cooking the
herring as there are days in the year; even
Bismarck invented one, but there are other
fish in the sea which demand Chaffinda’s
attention, and however enticing the subject
may be, it will not do to linger over it.</p>

<p>The lordly salmon was not always so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
honoured in its exclusiveness as it is to-day.
In our grandfathers’ time it was still frequenting
the Thames, and London servants,
when engaged, used to stipulate that they
were not to be fed on it more than twice a
week.</p>


<p class="sec">Chafed Salmon.</p>

<p>This is as good a way as any of treating
the salmon in the Chafing Dish:</p>

<p>Put two tablespoonsful of butter in the
pan and when it is melting stir in gradually
a tablespoon of flour, and keep on stirring
till it is smooth; add a wineglass of water,
the juice of a whole lemon, a small onion
cut in rings, and the yolks of two eggs, hard-boiled
and mashed up. When all these
ingredients are well mixed, put in a thick
slice of previously boiled cold salmon,
simmer it for eight minutes. Tinned
salmon, of the very best brands only, may
also be used, and the result is fairly satisfactory,
but tinned goods are of course only
a <i>pis aller</i> at best.</p>

<p>They do say that the Devil never goes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Cornwall because they put everything into a
pie down there, and he is afraid he might be
put into one too. I heard of Stargazer Pie
in Cornwall, and imagined that it referred to
the Riviera fish which is not succulent—indeed,
barely edible. But I learned that
Stargazer Pie is really Pilchard Pie, the
heads of the fish popping up through the
crust.</p>


<p class="sec">Cod Pudding.</p>

<p>A good Cornish way of cooking cod is to
make a pudding of it, which is quite chaffable.
Use a thick slice of cold cooked cod. Remove
skin and bones and flake it up smallish with
a couple of forks. Put it in the Chafing
Dish with two tablespoons of butter and one
of chopped onions; hot it up, and whilst
heating (lower the flame before actual boiling)
add gradually enough milk to make the fish
of the consistency of mashed potatoes; add
pepper and salt, and serve it with sippets of
toast. It will like you much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Souchet of Sprats.</p>

<p>Now for sprats; a good supper dish, and
eke for breakfast too, because they are so fat
that no butter or oil is required, but plenty
of salt and pepper. Buy a pint of fresh
sprats, soak and dry them very carefully,
handling them as little as possible. Cook
them as a water souchet or Zootje, an old
Dutch method, formerly much honoured at
Greenwich fish dinners, and originally made
of flounders. But flounders are not convenient
for a Chafing Dish, so you must perforce
fall back on sprats. Don’t slip!</p>

<p>Cut off the heads and tails of the sprats
and put them into the pan with a cupful of
thin bouillon, three sprigs of parsley, half a
sliced carrot, and plenty of salt and pepper.
Let this boil up for ten minutes. Take it
off; strain the liquor, return the fish to the
pan with three more sprigs of parsley and
another sliced half carrot. Boil up again for
five minutes this time. A squeeze of lemon
and a glass of sherry to be added just before
serving, of course with the sauce round the
fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>It has always been said, although it is
scarcely provable, that fish, owing to the
phosphorus, is good as a brainmaker. A
visitor at a Devonshire fishing village asked
the parson what was the principal diet of the
villagers. “Fish mostly,” said the Vicar.
“But I thought fish was a brain food, and
these are the most unintelligent folk I ever
saw,” remarked the tourist. “Well,” replied
the parson, “just think what they would look
like if they didn’t eat fish!”</p>

<p>In America the lobster is a frequent victim
of the Chafing Dish, and there are many and
diverse ways of torturing his succulent flesh
therein. I will give three recipes of a more
simple nature, all of which have been tried
and proven not guilty of indigestion. I
should premise, however, that to my individual
taste a lobster is only really good in two ways.
First, plain boiled and eaten cold with a
vinaigrette sauce; and, secondly, as a simple
salad with lettuce and perchance a stray
tomato. However, there may be others with
different tastes, and to such I commend the
following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Buttered Lobster.</p>

<p>First, Buttered Lobster. Beat up two
egg yolks with two tablespoons of butter
until it makes a smooth cream; add a wineglass
of milk or cream, a pinch of black
pepper, and half a teaspoon of Paprika. Put
it in the Chafing Dish with the meat of a
lobster cut into inch pieces, add the coral.
Let it simmer for ten minutes, keeping the
flame well under control.</p>


<p class="sec">Polly Lobster.</p>

<p>The next recipe is called Polly Lobster, and
it is toothsome. Cut up the lobster into inch
lumps, put it in the dish with two or three
tablespoons of salad oil, according to its size;
add three or four whole onions, a small bunch
of chives, pepper and salt, a wineglass of
sherry, and three quartered tomatoes. Let
it boil up for a couple of minutes, squeeze
a lemon over it, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Flattered Lobster.</p>

<p>The last variation on the lobster theme is
somewhat elaborate. It is termed Flattered
Lobster, the reason being, I opine, because of
the many added attractions to the crustacean’s
native simplicity. It is not quite orthodox
perhaps, but extraordinarily nice. Cut up
the meat of a large lobster into cubes. Make
a mixture of two tablespoons of Worcester
sauce, the same of vinegar, a wineglass of
claret, a dessertspoon of made mustard
(French for choice), salt and Paprika to taste.
Put the lobster in the Chafer and pour the
mixture over it, adding a tablespoon of butter
and the like of flour. Let it all heat up
gently and slowly; that is, begin with a full
flame and reduce after five minutes. Then
pour in a liqueur glass of brandy, and heat it
up again with full flame for eight minutes, stirring
it all the time. The result is surprising.</p>

<p>A fish story which is not without charm is
told of a seaside village school of very rough
fishing lads. The teacher gave them this sum
to do: “If two herrings cost three half-pence,
what would thirty cost?” After ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
minutes’ hard work he noticed one of the
boys had filled his copy-book full of figures.
“Well, Jim, what’s your answer?” “Please,
teacher, ’alf a crown.” “Wrong, Jim, try
again. If two herrings——” “Wait a bit,
teacher,” the lad interrupted, “’errings you
said. ’Ow silly of me; I was a-reckoning
of ’em like ’addocks.”</p>

<p>Prawns lend themselves most kindly to
Chafing-Dish cookery, and can be treated in
sundry appetising ways. Fresh prawns are
of course quite the best, but the Barataria
canned article is not to be despised, if they be
carefully washed before using; and there are
one or two brands of bottled prawns which
cook excellently.</p>


<p class="sec">Digestive Prawns.</p>

<p>Shell two dozen prawns, put them in the
Chafing Dish with half a pint of milk, half a
teaspoon of Paprika, a pinch of salt, and a
sprinkling of nutmeg. Keep stirring till near
boiling-point, then lower the flame; add a
glass of sherry and two beaten eggs; simmer
for eight minutes, and then serve on toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Prawn Wiggle.</p>

<p>The next is an American recipe and
rejoices in the name of Prawn Wiggle.
Melt three tablespoons of butter in the dish,
and two tablespoons of flour mixed with a
teaspoon of salt and a good pinch of pepper.
Stir up and then pour in gradually half a pint
of milk. As soon as the sauce thickens add
a cupful of prawns and a cupful of cold
cooked green peas. Mix up well and simmer
for eight minutes. The pink and green form
a delightsome colour blend, suggesting certain
well-known racing colours, and the combined
flavours are most delicate. But why “wiggle”?
Well, why not?</p>


<p class="sec">Prawns on the Grass.</p>

<p>Prawns on the Grass is recommendable,
easy, and decorative for the supper-table.
Butter lightly the bottom of the Chafing
Dish, half fill it with carefully prepared
cooked cold spinach; on this put a dozen
prawns, two eggs, hard-boiled and cut in
quarters; arrange these symmetrically, add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
pepper, salt, and a cupful of milk. Cover up
and let it simmer steadily for ten to twelve
minutes. Serve in the Chafing Dish with
sippets of toast.</p>

<p>It is impossible to treat here of the delectable
crayfish, crawfish, and langouste; they
are all cookable and easily digested. Best of
all, perhaps, are the Oder Krebse, and the
Swedish Kräftor, with their delightful and
unique flavour and sweetness, but they must
be eaten near where they are born in order
to be appreciated.</p>

<p>In the company of chaste Chaffinda it is
easy to enjoy a <i>maigre</i> day, for she deals so
delicately with fish that one is almost tempted
to envy the days of “Cecil’s Fast.” It will
be remembered that Lord Burleigh introduced
a Bill to enjoin the eating of fish only on
certain days, on all creeds alike, in order to
restore the fish trade.</p>

<p>It would be highly improper to devote a
chapter to fish without referring to Vatel
committing suicide on his sword (or was it a
skewer?), but the story is as stale as the fish
would be when it did arrive after all. A
century ago his memory was rather painfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
honoured by roasted slices of cod on a spit,
the dish being called <i>à la Vatel</i>.</p>

<p>To many worthy folk, painters in particular,
the magic word trout immediately suggests
Varnishing Day at the Paris Salon, and
<i>déjeuner</i> at Ledoyen’s. Trout with green
sauce is the staple traditional dish of the day.
A couple of years ago I had the curiosity to
inquire how much was eaten, and the <i>maître
d’hôtel</i> gave me the following figures: 250
lbs. of trout; 15 gallons of green sauce;
120 chickens; 80 ducks; 40 saddles of lamb;
170 bundles of asparagus; and 100 baskets
of strawberries. Besides this, the usual
thousand and one odds and ends of a miscellaneous
<i>carte du jour</i>. Painters have proverbially
good appetites.</p>


<p class="sec">Oysters.</p>

<p>Purposely, and of <i>malice prepense</i>, I am
carefully omitting all mention of the cooking
of oysters in any shape or form. I consider
it <i>néfaste</i>—almost sacrilegious. Our natives
are so exquisitely succulent, so absolutely
perfect in their delicacy, that to paint the lily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
or to gild refined gold were pickaninny peccadilloes
compared to the cooking of the
oyster. It is different, I believe, in the
United States of America, where there are
various kinds of oysters, some requiring,
almost demanding, cooking to render them
palatable. Transatlantic cookery books are
full of oyster recipes, in many of which the
true oyster flavour must be entirely obliterated
by the superadded condiments. This
may be a question of gastronomic supply and
demand. But my humble Chafing Dish shall
not be defiled by the torture of the innocent
bivalve. <i>Dixi!</i></p>


<p class="sec">Trout in Small Broth.</p>

<p>To return to trout. The fresh-water fish,
the darling product of the stream, cannot be
too respectfully approached, whether from an
angling or a culinary point of view. Izaac
Walton, in his inimitable charm and wisdom,
has much to say thereon. Unfortunately his
methods are impracticable in a Chafing Dish.
I find the best way to treat a trout is with a
Court Bouillon. This is how to make it:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Mix a glass of sherry, a tablespoon of vinegar,
a glass of water, two bay leaves, a dozen
peppercorns, a bunch of parsley, a sliced
onion, and a pinch of salt. Amalgamate
these materials thoroughly. Have your trout
well cleaned and dried. Pop him into the
Chafing Dish and cover him with the Court
Bouillon. Let it cook slowly but steadily for
twenty minutes. Then eat it with thanks
and praise.</p>


<p class="sec">Smothered Turbot.</p>

<p>Here is a good way of preparing the
remains of turbot. It is called Smothered
Turbot, and is founded on an old Hastings
fishwife’s recipe. Butter the inside of the
Chafing Dish; spread thereon a layer of
bread crumbs, chopped mushrooms, parsley,
cut-up lemon peel, pepper and salt. Break
up the cold cooked turbot small and make a
second layer thereof. Add two tablespoons
of butter, and then another layer the same as
the first. Heat up and keep at a good heat
for twelve minutes. Serve it in the Chafing
Dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Sardines in a Hurry.</p>

<p>Sardines are one of the handiest of standbys
for the Chafist. But get the best brands and
smallish fish; the large ones are apt to suggest
pilchards, which, although good in their
way, are not sardines.</p>

<p>Sardines in a Hurry are done thusly: Take
the sardines out of the box carefully on to a
plate, pour boiling water over them, and
drain it off at once. Take off all the skin,
bone them, and cut off the tails. Prepare thin
strips of hot buttered toast, put a sardine on
each strip, pepper and salt it, pour over it a
modicum of plain melted butter and a squeeze
of lemon juice. Put them into the Chafing
Dish and hot up for five minutes.</p>


<p class="sec">Waldorf Sardines.</p>

<p>Another very good if not quite as simple
a way of preparing them is Waldorf Sardines.
Pour boiling water over a dozen sardines,
wiping off the skin with a clean fish-cloth and
removing the tails. Put them in the Chafing
Dish with one tablespoon of olive oil and
heat thoroughly for eight minutes. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
them aside on a dish and keep them hot.
Now put another tablespoon of olive oil into
the pan, and when sizzling add a cupful of
water. Stir until it gets thick, then add a
teaspoon of Worcester sauce, half a teaspoon
of Paprika, and a pinch of salt. Take the
dish off the flame. Add the beaten yolk of
an egg, one teaspoon of vinegar and the same
of French mustard. Stir the sauce. Heat
up the sardines again, and pour the sauce
over them. As a supper dish, say after a
Royal Institution lecture, or something
equally improving, this gives one what the
late George du Maurier called “a sense of
genial warmth about the midriff.”</p>


<p class="sec">Creamed Smelts.</p>

<p>A rather more subtle but curiously refined
concoction is Creamed Smelts.</p>

<p>Clean and dry a dozen smelts in a cloth.
Dip them one by one in thick cream, or,
wanting that, in milk thickened with flour;
then dredge them with flour so as to make a
paste coating all over them. Put two tablespoons
of butter in the Chafing Dish, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
when sizzling put in the fish with a squeeze
of lemon and a glass of sherry. They will
be ready in eight minutes. Sprinkle fried
parsley over them before serving.</p>

<p>The delicate faint perfume of the smelt
has been likened to that of the cucumber,
violets and verbena. It is quite unique
among fish, and has a charm that is all its
own. This method of cooking preserves
this peculiarity. Some other methods do not.
Avoid buying sand-smelts (Atherines). They
are very similar to the real thing, but lack
the characteristic perfume, and they are
neither as delicate in flavour or taste.</p>


<p class="sec">Kedgeree.</p>

<p>All Anglo-Indians, and many who have
never been nearer India than South Kensington,
know the virtues of kedgeree,
kadgiori, kitchri, kegeree, kitcharee, kitchery,
or even quitheri. It is spelt and made in
forty-seven different ways, every one of which
is strictly authentic, and, according to different
authorities, the One and Only way. This is
Martin Harvey Kedgeree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Boil two cupfuls of rice, and strain it well.
Mix in it two chopped cold hard-boiled eggs,
any cold remains of cooked fish, flaked and
salted; add a tablespoon of butter, the same
of milk, a teaspoon of Paprika, and half a
teaspoon of salt. Toss it all about in the
Chafing Dish thoroughly, and then hot it up
for ten minutes. Squeeze a lemon over it
just before serving. Kedgeree is by no
means solely a breakfast dish. It comes in
handily at all times, but never argue about
kedgeree with an Anglo-Indian. It is fatal
to the kedgeree. It gets cold—and then
<i>vois que c’est triste pour vous</i>, as Mephistopheles
sings when he looks at Siebel’s
hand.</p>

<p>Next to the Indian, the Chinese is one of
the most inventive cooks in the world. I
had one once who had been, amongst other
things, a pirate, a prison-warder, an actor, and
a judge. He had sudden inspirations, and
therein lay his weakness. He knew that
English folk ate jelly with mutton, so he tried
strawberry jam with eggs and bacon, and
following the principle of apple sauce with
goose, he gave me hot cherry brandy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
roast fowl. He was a bad cook, but a most
fluent and ingenious liar.</p>

<p>The best-flavoured eels are those that come
from the Thames;, they are much better than
the Dutch. There are four kinds: the Snig,
the Grig, the Broadnosed, and the Sharp-nosed.
The last are the best. Izaak Walton
says: “It is agreed that the eel is a most
dainty dish”—and who shall say him nay?
The Greeks went further and called it “the
Helen of the dinner-table,” because every
guest strove, like Paris, to keep it for himself.</p>


<p class="sec">Souchet of Eels.</p>

<p>To make a water souchet of eels follow the
directions for sprats, but cut the eels into
inch chunks, and boil for half as long again
in each case. Some folks think that eels are
at their best in a souchet, which has the
tendency of bringing out the best flavour of
the fish.</p>

<p>Jellied eels and stewed eels, both East End
and racecourse prime favourites, are somewhat
too rich and coarse for any save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
very ravenous, but it is certain that there is a
deal of rich, if perhaps somewhat heavy,
nourishment in the eel, and its meat is a great
delicacy in any form.</p>


<p class="sec">Nettled Eels.</p>

<p>Nettled Eels are much esteemed in Normandy.
They may be prepared in the same
fashion as water souchet, with the addition of
a handful of clean washed young nettles,
which should be cooked with the fish but
taken out before serving. They give a
peculiar zest to the dish, which is quite
pleasant.</p>


<p class="sec">Matelote of Eels.</p>

<p>The classic form of the eel is as a Matelote,
originally a marine dish, and quite within
Chaffinda’s compass. Have your eel cut into
inch-and-a-half lengths, about one pound in
all; put a large walnut of butter, or two
tablespoons of oil in the Chafing Dish, also a
dozen small peeled onions; let them brown
thoroughly and frizzle well; add a tablespoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of flour, a teaspoon of Paprika, and half as
much salt. Heat up and stir well until it is
all thoroughly amalgamated, then put in six
small mushrooms, flat or button (fresh of
course), add a good squeeze of lemon, and if
the mixture is thicker than cream, pour in a
little water. Now put in a tumbler (half-pint)
of good claret, a couple of cloves, a bay
leaf, and a teacup of bouillon. Let the mixture
simmer for eight minutes, after which
put in the eel and a liqueur glass of brandy,
and cook for another ten minutes; then
serve very hot. An orthodox variation is to
set light to the brandy before pouring it in
and if the boiling wine catches fire it gives a
peculiar savour. A well-made Matelote is a
thing of joy, a combination of harmonies,
culminating in one grand Amen. Izaak
Walton designates such a dish a “Hogoo.”</p>


<p class="sec">Grandfather’s Bloaters.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a dish which is superlative
in its simplicity. It is not a Chafing-Dish
recipe, but is yet not altogether out of place.
It is called Grandfather’s Bloaters. Put two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
fine bloaters into a soup-plate, pour over
them enough whisky just to cover them. Set
light to the whisky, and let it burn itself out.
The bloaters will then be done—and done
exquisitely. The dish is attributed to Charles
Sala, the father of the late George Augustus
Sala. It reads much more bibulous than it
really is. As a matter of fact, it is almost a
temperance dish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> has always been a puzzle to me why folks
take flesh and fowl so much more seriously
than fish and vegetables. Your fair neighbour
at a dinner-party will prattle gaily
through soup and fish, of polo or pantomime,
according to the season, but as soon as meat
or bird makes its appearance she, all unconsciously,
dives into deeper topics, and talks of
palæontology or premature burial. Why?
Of course, if this had only happened to myself,
I should know that I was a sepulchral
bore, but I find, on inquiry, that it is the
experience of nine men out of ten.</p>

<p>In W. H. Mallock’s “New Republic,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
some quite nice people find before them at
dinner a menu of the conversation expected
of them, as well as of the food to be eaten.
It was arranged something after the fashion
of the bill of fare of a great dinner where the
wines are indicated against each course. Thus
instead of <i>Tortue Claire—Amontillado</i>, something
like this, <i>Crême d’Asperges—Our
Foreign Policy</i>, was printed on the card. Mr.
Mallock relates that the scheme was not found
practicable, but the idea, in itself, seems
alluring and full of possibilities. Anyhow, it
is obvious to the most casual diner-out that
there is a direct, if indefinable, link between
cates and conversation, and that the tide of
talk ebbs and flows through the menu according
to a certain unascertained but more
or less fixed law.</p>

<p>The great question of Sauce has broken up
many Damon-Pythias friendships, and brought
havoc into sundry happy homes. No two
people think exactly alike on Sauces. There
are so many schools. The Flamboyant, the
Renaissance, the Simplicists, the Natural
Flavourites, the Neo-Soho, and many others.
The only way to gastronomic salvation is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
steer a careful course between extremes, and
to take that which is best and most expedient
from each and every school.</p>

<p>A very refined and intelligent cannibal
once had the politeness to ask the future
ornament of his stock-pot, “With what sauce
would you like to be eaten?” “But I don’t
want to be eaten at all,” was the reply. “That
is entirely beside the question,” said the cannibal.
This rather suggests the famous Green
Sauce which La Coste offered to Sir Thomas
Dundas, at the Duke of York’s table, with
the whispered advice, “With this sauce you
would enjoy eating your grandfather.”</p>

<p>Do what we will, we cannot get away from
Sauce. It is a necessary if unobtrusive concomitant
of the plainest meats. But it can be
mitigated, assuaged; and from a loathly
disguise it can be transformed into a dulcet
accompaniment. “Les animaux se repaissent;
l’homme mange: l’homme d’esprit seul sait
manger,” said Brillat-Savarin, who achieved
much of his literary success by gross flattery
of the palates of his friends. Charles de
Monselet, the author of “La Cuisinière
Poétique,” and a very earnest advocate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
simplicity, as against rioting in the stewpans,
wrote: “The man who pays no attention to
the food he consumes can only be likened to
a pig in whose trough the trotters of his own
son, a pair of braces, and a box of dominoes
are equally welcome.”</p>

<p>At the same time the affectation of simplicity
is often grossly overdone. When
Lord Byron first met Tom Moore at Samuel
Rogers’ rooms in St. James’s Place, the noble
lord affected a lack of appetite for anything
except potatoes and vinegar, biscuits and soda
water; but he made a very hearty meal at
his club afterwards. Again, Percy Bysshe
Shelley, who was certainly not affected, but
probably absent-minded, when he felt hungry
would dash into the first baker’s shop, buy a
loaf, and rush out again, breaking off pieces
as he walked, and eating them there and then,
his scanty meal being eked out by common
raisins, a small stock of which he kept in his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>By way of contrast, it is related of George
Frederick Handel, the great composer, a man
of voracious appetite and exaggerated capacity,
that he ordered dinner for three at a tavern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and, being hungry, asked, “Is de tinner
retty?” The waiter replied that he was
waiting for the company to come. “I am
de gompany,” said Handel, “bring up de
tinner <i>prestissimo</i>.” This anecdote, probably
unveracious, is often attributed to Papa
Haydn—which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Joints and whole birds, save very small
ones, are of course out of the question with
a Chafing Dish, but steaks, cutlets, disjointed
birds, and a thousand varieties of treating
flesh and fowl, raw and cooked, are well
within its range.</p>


<p class="sec">Rump Steak.</p>

<p>Beef steak, or rump steak, is very palatable
cooked in the following manner. Give a
one-pound steak a thorough beating. Mallets
are made for this express purpose, but if such
an implement be not available, I have used
the head of a poker, wrapped in cloth, with
great effect. This drubbing makes the meat
tender. Put the steak into the dish with
two tablespoons of butter and three slices of
lemon. Cook it slowly for twelve minutes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Then pour over it a cupful of bouillon and
a wine-glass of claret. Simmer it for ten
minutes more with an added teaspoon of
Worcester sauce, salt and pepper. Before serving
the steak, which ought to be thoroughly
tender, squeeze a lemon over it. Onions
are, I venture to think, a great improvement,
and two of them, cut in rings, may
well be added, after the first twelve minutes’
cooking.</p>

<p>The Roast Beef of Old England which
has done so much to maintain the reputation
of Great Britain on the Continent, is strangely
mistreated and man-handled in foreign parts.
It is often served <i>saignant</i> or nearly raw,
under the mistaken belief that we like it that
way. Moreover, in very old French cookery
books, roast mutton and roast lamb are
gravely designated <i>Rosbif de Mouton</i> and
<i>Rosbif d’Agneau</i> respectively. Was this sheer
flattery, or ignorance, or both?</p>


<p class="sec">Devilled Beef.</p>

<p>Devilled Beef can be highly recommended
in this fashion: Three thick slices of cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
cooked roast beef, lean. Butter them as
though they were slices of bread. Then dose
them liberally with the following mixture:
One teaspoon made mustard, half a teaspoon
black pepper, same of salt, a teaspoon of
Worcester sauce, and a tablespoon of vinegar.
Cook them in this in the Chafing Dish,
until the meat begins to curl up at the
edges.</p>

<p>This, although very good, is mere journeyman
work and not a “creation.” Did not
Aristotle say that a man who eats a dinner
is a better judge of it than the cook? That
is judgment, however, not creation, and the
French cook-artists call their dishes “creations”—like
the dressmakers.</p>

<p>A chop, I contend, should only be cooked
on a gridiron—grilled, that is to say, over an
open fire. Any other treatment is an offence
which, in a more enlightened age, would be
made indictable. St. Lawrence would rise in
his grave and object, were a chop put in a
Chafing Dish—and quite right too! St.
Lawrence is of course the patron saint of the
grill, for is he not said to have been broiled
alive on a gridiron? According to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
respectable authority of Foxe’s Book of
Martyrs, his dying words were:</p>

<p class="sec">Chipped Beef.</p>

<p>One of the best things produced in
America, besides buyers of spurious art
works and donors of Free Libraries, is
Chipped Beef. You can buy it in tins and
treat it thus. Put three tablespoons of
butter in the dish. When just melted add a
tablespoon of flour; stir until smooth.
Then add the Chipped Beef, which must
have been previously soaked in cold water
for ten minutes; let it simmer for eight
minutes, then stir in the beaten-up yolks of
two eggs, and serve very hot. Every day is
Thanksgiving Day when one eats Chipped
Beef, and it is a selfish dish to cook, because
one wants to eat it all oneself; and the worst
of eating is that it takes away one’s appetite—although
there is a proverb to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>But it is always comfortable to be content
(or nearly so) on good plain food, instead of
on the misguided concoctions of addle-egged

<p class="sec">Zrazy.</p>

<p>This is how to make Polish Zrazy in a
Chafing Dish. Buy the whole undercut
(fillet) of a small sirloin. Cut it into inch
slices. Brown two sliced onions in the Dish
in a large walnut of butter. Add the meat,
a teaspoon of Paprika, salt, and half a dozen
cloves. Cover up, and let it hot up to
boiling. Do not uncover, as the great thing
is to let it steam in its own <i>fumet</i>. Shake
the pan now and again, so that it shall
amalgamate well. After once boiling up,
let it simmer for fifteen minutes, add a good
squeeze of lemon, a glass of claret, and serve
with the accompaniment of potato salad.</p>

<p>“This dish of meat is too good for any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
but anglers, or very honest men,” says Izaak
Walton of a like concoction.</p>


<p class="sec">Frizzled Ham.</p>

<p>Do you think you would like Frizzled
Ham? I do; and this is how I cook it.
Start with half a pound of rather fat ham in
thin slices. Put half a tablespoon of butter
in the pan, and when very hot add the ham.
As soon as it begins to curl at the edges,
dust the slices with dry flour, which will soon
turn brown. Turn the lamp down and keep
simmering. Now mix in a bowl half a tablespoon
of vinegar and the same of dry
mustard. Pour it over the ham, add enough
boiling water to cover the meat, put in three
drops of Tabasco, and let it all boil up for a
minute.</p>


<p class="sec">Ham in Hades.</p>

<p>Another and somewhat similar way of
preparing ham, which has been very successful,
particularly at supper-time, after, say, a
lobster salad, has been christened <i>Ham in
Hades</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Make a mixture of a teaspoon of made
mustard, a tablespoon of Tarragon vinegar,
a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of Paprika, a teaspoon
of Worcester sauce. Spread this
mixture on both sides of half a dozen slices
of ham. Put two tablespoons of olive oil in
the Chafer. When this begins to smoke, put in
the ham and brown it quickly on both sides.</p>


<p class="sec">Gallimaufrey.</p>

<p>Gallimaufrey is a very old dish, meaning
really <i>All Sorts</i>. Shakespeare calls it Gaily-Mawfrey.
A very excellent Modern Gallimaufrey
is prepared thus: Three thickish
slices of ham with two walnuts of butter in
the Dish. Let it cook slowly. Add six
peeled and washed Jerusalem artichokes,
three sliced carrots, one sliced onion. Let it
go on simmering. Now put in a couple of
dozen haricot beans, a sprig of parsley, three
cloves, a wineglass of sherry, a blade of
mace, salt, pepper, and a teaspoon of sugar.
Simmer it for twenty minutes, bringing it at
last just to the boil. It is then an agreeable
stew, which is probably as totally unlike the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
real old-fashioned Gallimaufrey as anything
possibly could be. But that really does not
matter.</p>

<p>Gallimaufrey dates back to the time of
Master Robert May, who published a memorable
cook-book in 1660, which is not without
its humours. A real old English banquet,
it seems, would not be complete without
two pies, the one filled with live frogs, and
the other with birds. These are for the
particular delectation of the ladies. “They
will desire to see what is in the pies; where
lifting first the lid off one pie, out skips
some frogs, which makes the ladies to skip
and shreek; next after the other pie, whence
come out the birds, who, by a natural instinct,
flying at the light, will put out the
candles. So that what with frogs beneath,
and birds above, it will cause much delight
and pleasure to the whole company.”</p>

<p>They were right merry folk then!</p>


<p class="sec">Bubble and Squeak.</p>

<p>Not to know Bubble and Squeak is to
admit one’s ignorance of one of the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
things of this earth. Chaffinda can tackle
it, and in this wise. It is an old Cornish
version. There may be others, but there
can be none better. The dish needs cabbage,
and it is most practical to get a young fresh
cabbage, boiled, pressed, and chopped into
shreds before you begin the actual cooking.
It saves time and trouble. Put a tablespoon
of butter in the Chafing Dish, also
one chopped onion, and the cabbage. Let
it frizzle and absorb the butter. Just before
boiling, add gradually a cupful of milk,
pepper and salt. As soon as it boils up,
take it off and put it aside in a hot dish.
Now hot up three underdone slices of cooked
cold roast beef in two tablespoons of butter,
turning them frequently, so that they shall
be well cooked on both sides; add a tablespoon
of Worcester sauce and the same of
vinegar. Now make a mound of the cooked
cabbage, and put the slices of well-done meat
around it, upright. You will regret that
you did not cook double the quantity.</p>

<p>There are so many kinds of sausages that
it is difficult to pitch upon the best for
Chafing purposes. Slices of the Brunswick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
species are excellent in pea-soup. The genuine
liver sausage makes good sandwiches. The
more elaborate French kinds are akin to
galantine. The Italian Bologna and Mortadella
have their friends. But, after all,
the well-made Cambridge sausage is hard to
beat. I plump for the Cambridge variety.</p>


<p class="sec">Hodge’s Sausages.</p>

<p>This is a Cambridge recipe for Hodge’s
Sausages. Put as many as you think you
can eat in the dish with a walnut of butter
for every two, pepper and salt, and a tablespoon
of Worcester sauce. Then add one
sliced apple for each sausage. Take out the
cores, but do not peel them. Stab the
sausages with a fork to prevent their bursting.
Cook for twelve minutes. American
apples are good for this dish, and also
the homegrown Keswick Codlin, Blenheim
Orange, or Hambledon Deux Ans.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly bucolic about
Hodge’s Sausages which may commend itself
to the rurally minded. To me, it brings the
scent of the hay over the spirit-lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Goulasch.</p>

<p>Another appetising stew is Goulasch. Beat
well a half-pound (or larger) steak; cut it
into pieces the size of a domino. Put them
in the Chafing Dish with two cold cooked
potatoes chopped into dice. Pour over the
meat and the vegetables two tablespoons of
olive oil, and as soon as it simmers add an
onion in slices, half a teaspoon of Paprika,
salt, and a cupful of bouillon. Cover it up,
and let it cook for ten minutes, stirring
occasionally. Just before serving drop in
half a dozen stoned olives.</p>

<p>So much for beef. The next meat is of
course mutton, for which three recipes should
suffice. The first is Mutton Steaks, and is
adapted from a Welsh recipe. I have a very
interesting Welsh cookery book, tersely
entitled: “Llyfr Cogino a Chadw ty: yn
cynwys Pa fodd? A Paham? Cogyddiaeth.”
I am sorry that ignorance prevents my giving
anything out of it, but I think that I have
got the title nearly right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Mutton Steaks.</p>

<p>To make Mutton Steaks, cut three slices,
each an inch thick, from the middle of a cold
cooked leg of mutton. Put them in the
Dish with enough water to cover them, pepper
and salt, and five small onions. Cover it up
and let the meat brown thoroughly on one
side, then turn it over and add a walnut of
butter and a tablespoon of flour. Do not
allow it to boil, but keep it simmering gently
for at least fifteen minutes. If raw meat be
used, the result is also quite satisfactory, but
it is well in that case to replace the water by
a cup of bouillon.</p>


<p class="sec">Turkish Mutton.</p>

<p>Turkish Mutton, locally termed <i>Etena
Jarvat</i>: this is one of those dishes which
may fairly be included in Brillat-Savarin’s
<i>magistères restoratifs</i>. It is easy enough to
chafe.</p>

<p>Cut half a pound of uncooked mutton
(from the leg from choice, but not absolutely
necessary) into medium dice. Put the meat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
into the Chafing Dish with salt, pepper and
dripping, fat, oil, or butter, according to
taste, but oil is preferable. When the meat
turns brown, add half a pound of previously
cooked and sliced French beans, also half a
pint of water or bouillon (latter for choice) and
a bunch of simples, either thyme or marjoram,
or both. Simmer steadily for twenty minutes,
stirring occasionally. Carrots can be used
instead of beans. Just before serving turn
up the flame full, and let it come just to the
boil.</p>


<p class="sec">Mutton Venison.</p>

<p>Mutton Venison is a compromise, and may
be recommended as such. We live in an age
of compromise, so why not bring it into our
cookery? Make an extra strong decoction
of bouillon from any good meat-juice, three
tablespoons in quantity, mince into it an
onion, and put in the pan with a tablespoonful
of Worcester sauce, three drops of Tabasco,
a glass of claret, a dessert-spoon of red-currant
jelly (or guava or blackberry jelly),
pepper and salt. When very hot put in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
about a pound of slices of cold cooked leg of
mutton, lean, cut into strips. Let it simmer
for twenty minutes. It is not a bit like
venison, but distinctly good nevertheless.</p>


<p class="sec">Plump and Wallop.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>


<p>This advertisement, it is alleged, was
addressed to the good people of Kirkmahoe,
who were so poor that they could not afford
to put any meat into their broth. A cobbler
invested all his money in buying four sheep
shanks, and when a neighbour wanted to
make mutton broth, for the payment of one
halfpenny the cobbler would “plump” one
of the sheep shanks into the boiling water
and give it a “wallop,” or whisk round. He
then wrapped it in a cabbage leaf and took it
home. This was called a “gustin bone,”
and was supposed to give a rich “gust” to
the broth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Potatoes and Point.</p>

<p>A Boer recipe of much the same description
was known in early Transvaal days (long
before the War) as “Potatoes and Point.”
The poor “Bijwoner” family was served all
round with potatoes, and a red herring was
hung up in the middle of the room. The
elders were allowed to rub their potatoes on
the herring, but the youngsters might only
point theirs towards the delicacy at the end
of a fork. The mere proximity of the
highly-flavoured herring was supposed to
give the potato a flavour.</p>

<p>Lots of quite worthy folk gorge themselves
periodically and keep their children on the
border-line of starvation. A certain exaggeratedly
selfish family man of my acquaintance,
who for economic reasons lived somewhere
in the wilds of West Kensington,
made it his unholy practice to dine once a
month with a couple of boon companions of
the same sex at the Carlton or Prince’s, and at
the conclusion of a remarkable dinner was wont
to blurt out: “By George, I wish I could
afford to bring the wife and children here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Scouse.</p>

<p>Permit me now to suggest a trial of that
very old and famous dish, Scouse. It is prepared
in the following fashion: Get one
pound of lean, dairy-fed pork, cooked and
cold. Cut it into half-inch squares; sprinkle
them with flour, salt, Paprika, and dip them
lightly in French mustard. Put in the
Chafing Dish three chopped onions, half a
teaspoon of sugar, one wine-glass of vinegar,
three cloves, a blade of mace and a bayleaf.
Cover up and let it simmer, not boil, while
the quantity of liquid is reduced by one half.
Add the pork with half a pint of bouillon,
and simmer for another ten minutes.</p>

<p>Young pork, like young veal, is always
excellent, but it can be too young. A sucking
pig with lacklustre eye and a lemon in its
jaws is pathetic and none too appetising.
Veal, in England at any rate, is often tasteless
and somewhat dull. Not so very long ago,
in Ireland, they used to kill newborn calves,
bake them in an oven with potatoes, and call
the dish “Staggering Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Kabobs.</p>

<p>Kabobs have probably come to us from
India, via the Cape. This is an old Capetown-Malay
recipe which is thoroughly reliable.
Half a pound of cold veal; the same of lean
ham, both cut into slices a quarter of an inch
thick; three apples, and three onions. Cut
the meat and the vegetables into rounds with
a knife or cutter, about the size of a crown
piece. Skewer them up on wooden (or, if you
are a de Beers shareholder, on silver) skewers,
in the following order: (1) a round of veal;
(2) a round of apple; (3) a round of ham; (4)
around of onion. Sprinkle them with pepper,
salt and curry-powder. Put them in the
Chafing Dish with a teacupful of bouillon and
a walnut of butter; simmer steadily for twenty
minutes, then thicken the gravy with a little
flour, and serve either with boiled rice, or
toast, or both.</p>


<p class="sec">Brigands’ Fowls.</p>

<p>Cold fowls lend themselves in a hundred
ways to the kind attentions of Chaffinda.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Mention of quite a few of these must urge the
gastronomer to further experiments and discoveries.
<i>Pollio à la Contrabandista</i>: this is
the way brigands cook, or ought to cook,
fowls. Cut a cold cooked fowl into neat
joints. Put them into the Chafing Dish with
four tablespoons of olive oil, and heat up
until the meat is of a light brown colour,
turning the pieces frequently. Then keep the
flame lower and simmering all the time; add
four tomatoes cut into quarters, two chopped
green chillies, one shredded Spanish onion,
one tablespoon of Worcester sauce, the same
of mushroom ketchup, and four cloves. Let
it simmer, closely covered, for at least fifteen
minutes. It will then prove a most savoury
mess.</p>


<p class="sec">Howtowdie.</p>

<p>From Spain to Bonnie Scotland! This is
how to cook Howtowdie. Cut up a young
fowl into handy joints. Put them into the
Chafing Dish with two walnuts of butter, a
cupful of bouillon, three sprigs of parsley,
three small onions, salt and pepper. Simmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
continuously until the bird is tender. When
half cooked add another cupful of bouillon to
make up for evaporation. When quite cooked
put the fowl on to a hot dish, surround it
with poached eggs, then thicken the gravy in
the pan with a tablespoon of flour and a tablespoon
of Worcester sauce; give it a smart
boil up and pour it over the fowl. This
Howtowdie is adapted from an excellent
recipe in “The Scottish Cookery Book containing
guid plain rules for makin’ guid plain
meats suitable for sma’ purses, big families,
and Scotch stomachs.”</p>


<p class="sec">Roman Fowl.</p>

<p>The preparation of Roman Fowl is simplicity
itself. Pour four tablespoons of olive
oil into the Chafing Dish with a pinch of salt,
a teaspoon of Paprika, three cloves, and herbs
to taste, but do not overdo the herbs. When
the oil is sizzling put in all the limbs of a
lightly boiled chicken, cut up. Cook it
slowly, turning the meat so that all the flesh
is equally cooked all over. When done it
should be a delicate brown. Add half a cupful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
of tomato sauce and the same of bouillon,
also three shredded onions. Simmer for
eight minutes, then serve.</p>


<p class="sec">Creamed Chicken.</p>

<p>This is an American recipe, copied verbatim
from an American Chafing-Dish cookery
book. Two cups cold chicken cut into small
pieces, one cup chicken stock, one cup milk
or cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one
heaping tablespoonful of flour, salt and pepper.
Cook the butter and the flour together in the
Chafing Dish; add the stock and milk and
stir until smooth; put in the chicken, salt and
pepper, and cook three minutes longer.</p>

<p>Other times, other manners. Contrast
with the severe simplicity of the above the
sort of thing that gratified the palates of our
forebears. In the fourteenth century,
Sacchetti says, a baked goose stuffed with
garlic and quinces was esteemed an excellent
dish in Italy, and when the Gonfalonier of
Florence entertained a famous doctor he gave
him the stomach of a calf, boiled partridges,
and pickled sardines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Old Samuel Pepys, too, had a nice taste in
food as in music, and other things. His idea
of “a fine dinner” was to this effect: “A
dish of marrowbones, a leg of mutton, a loin
of veal, a dish of fowl; three pullets and a
dozen of larks, all in a dish; a great tart, a
neat’s tongue, a dish of anchovies, a dish of
prawns, and cheese.”</p>

<p>For those who are curious in such things
it is easy to find quaint recipes in old books.
For instance, if you want to know how to
bake a hedgehog in clay—and very good it is
too—you have only to read Albert Smith’s
“Christopher Tadpole” and you will know
all about it. It is truly said that comparatively
few people read Disraeli’s novels nowadays,
but those who are culinarily inclined would
do well to turn to the opening chapter of
“Tancred,” where there is a delightful conversation
between a grand old <i>maître de bouche</i>,
“Papa Prevost,” and his pupil, the eminent
chef, Leander. The pompous spirit of the
culinary artist is delightfully caught and the
gastronomic jargon wonderfully reproduced.</p>

<p>But gastronomy has never lacked its
historians. Great painters have come to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
aid, as witness the glowing canvases of
Snyders, Teniers, Jordaens, Ruysdael, Jan
Weenix, Melchior de Hondecoeter and Jan
Fyt. Their pictures of still life, the poulterers’
shops, the heaped baskets of good cheer, the
brilliant lobster, the callow lemon, the russet
hare, and the lustrous plumage of the
pheasant, have inspired the hand of the
Masters, who must have appreciated all such
culinary delicacies in order to have painted
them with such loving-kindness.</p>


<p class="sec">Yesterday’s Pheasant.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Yesterday’s Pheasant can be made into a
most tempting dish by cutting up the remains
into convenient chunks, omitting the bones.
Put one tablespoon of butter in the Dish, add
a tablespoon of flour, and keep on stirring till
the mixture is smooth and light brown. Add
a glass of claret, a tablespoon of Worcester
sauce, pepper and salt, and bring to a boil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
stirring occasionally. Now put in the chunks
of pheasant, and simmer for eight minutes.
An excellent accompaniment to this is chestnut
and celery salad.</p>

<p>Any game bird may be treated in like
manner, save always the woodcock, that little
epitome of all that is toothsome and delicate.
A curious thing about the woodcock is its
extraordinarily rapid digestion. A single
bird has been known to consume in a night
more earthworms than half filled a moderate-sized
flowerpot.</p>

<p>Few people know the different expressions
for flocks of birds. Here are some of them:
a building of rooks, a bevy of quails, a watch
of nightingales, a cast of hawks, a nide of
pheasants, a muster of peacocks, a plump of
wildfowl, a flock of geese, a pack of grouse,
a chattering of choughs, a stand of plovers,
and a wisp of snipe.</p>

<p>A woman I know had a very good cook,
who was also a plain cook—or rather, a plain-spoken
cook. She had been in the place
many years, and much was forgiven her.
The mistress, visiting the kitchen, inspected
a turkey, and remarked that it was a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
thin bird. “Just you wait, M’m, till I’ve
stuffed it with chestnuts,” said the cook, “you
won’t know it then. It’ll be quite another
thing. Just like you, M’m, when you has
your di’monds on.”</p>

<p>I do not advise the fabrication of elaborate
entrées in the Chafing Dish. They can be
and have been done, but I mistrust them and
find ample scope for ingenuity, inventiveness,
and novelty in the cates I have already described,
without venturing into the fields of
fancy. Vol-au-Vent, for instance, or Brains
à la Poulette, or Spanish Cream Pudding are
all within the range of feasibility, but I leave
the recipes to those less timorous than myself.
In fact, in this case, I am at one with the
waiter in the “Bab Ballads” who hurled the
most awful threat in culinary literature at his
flighty sweetheart:</p>

<p>The good things of this life are mostly

Bengodi, Boccaccio’s country of content,
where they tie up the vines with sausages,
where you may buy a fat goose for a penny,

In this place there is a mountain of Parmesan
cheese, and the people’s employment is making
cheese-cakes and macaroons. There is also a
river which runs Malmsey wine of the very
best quality.</p>

<p>There are no cheap excursions to Bengodi.

the staff of life, or indeed as anything more
than a delicious aid thereto. It is possible
that the internal economy of certain very
worthy folk may be more easily conducted
on a vegetarian basis, and indeed every man
is at liberty to feed as suits him best; but
as a matter of preference, predilection and
experience, I decline to follow his example.
If they are content to let me go my way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
unmolested, I have no desire to interfere
with their tastes. But no proselytising,
please!</p>

<p>Here in England, although we shine in our
roasts, our beef, our chops, and maybe a few
other trifles, we are woefully and culpably
ignorant of vegetable cookery. The average
British cook has but one idea with vegetables.
She cooks them in water, with lumps of coarse
soda, which she thinks makes them soft and
keeps their colour. As a matter of fact,
this process, especially the soda, practically
destroys their health-giving properties. Vegetables
want the kindliest care, the most
delicate handling, the most knowledgeable
treatment. Otherwise they become mere
parodies of their better selves. What could
be more terrible, more depressing, than the
usual slab of wet cabbage doled out at the
average London restaurant? It is an insult
to the cabbage, to the guest, and to the
Art of Cookery. And it is so easy to cook
it decently—even in a Chafing Dish.</p>

<p>Again, the average British household knows
and uses only a very limited range of vegetables,
ignoring, wilfully or otherwise, scores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of edible delights, easily grown and easily
cooked, but with the inbred laziness of crass
conservatism, totally overlooked, because,
forsooth, “the greengrocer does not keep
it!” The greengrocer, on the other hand,
scorns the inquirer after such strange green
meats, because “they are never asked for”;
and so, between the two, we are relegated to
the same dull round of vegetable monotony.</p>

<p>Household cookery knows nothing of the
Aubergine, or Egg-plant, of which there are
fourteen edible varieties, most of which can
easily be grown in this country, although
the rich purple kinds are best suited to our
climate. Then there is Salsify, which is
amenable to a dozen different treatments;
as the vegetable oyster it is duly honoured
in America, but we know it not. The Good
King Harry is only known in Lincolnshire.
The leaves served as cabbage are excellent,
and the tender young shoots are as delicate
as asparagus. The Cardoon, Scornzonera,
Celeriac, Chicory, Buck’s Horn, Chervil,
Jew’s Mallow, Lovage, Purslane, Rampion,
Scurvy-Grass and Valerian, are only a selection
from a list thrice as long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>It is useless, however, to lift up one thin
quavering voice of protest in a wilderness
of deaf greengrocers. I must e’en deal with
the common vegetables of commerce, others
being unprocurable, and their cultivation a
counsel of perfection.</p>

<p>One naturally begins with potatoes, though
the reason of their position in the hierarchy
of the garden is occult. Sir Walter Raleigh,
good man and true, has much to answer for.
Tobacco <i>and</i> potatoes! I believe it to be
a fact that throughout the length and breadth
of Ireland there is no memorial to Raleigh.
This seems a distinct omission. But then,
neither is there a statue to Lord Verulam!</p>

<p>Between the primitive tuber, baked in the
ashes, and <i>Pommes à la Rèjane</i>, there lies the
whole gamut of culinary ingenuity. They
are the extremes of sophistication and the
opposite. But it must suffice here to give a
few only of the simplest recipes, well within
Chaffinda’s modest capability, and in their
very ingenuousness fit alike for the delectation
of Prince or Pauper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Mary’s Potatoes.</p>

<p>The first method is called Mary’s Potatoes
for want of a better name. Slice up half
a dozen cold cooked potatoes. Put them
in the Chafing Dish with a walnut of butter
and a cupful of milk; let them simmer for
five minutes, then add the juice of half a
lemon, a teaspoon of chopped parsley, pepper
and salt. Simmer for five minutes more.</p>


<p class="sec">Potato Uglies.</p>

<p>Cut up half a dozen cold cooked potatoes
into quarter-inch slices. Put four slices of
fat bacon into the Chafing Dish, and hot up
until the fat begins to smoke; then drop in
the potatoes, add pepper and salt, and cook
for five minutes. Drain before serving.</p>


<p class="sec">Sala’s Potatoes.</p>

<p>Cut four potatoes in slices as large as
a halfpenny, but twice as thick. Put two
tablespoonsful of butter in the Chafing Dish,
and a dozen delicate little onions cut into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
dice. Hot up the onions and butter till
the former turn a golden brown, then add
the potatoes and a teaspoon of chopped
parsley, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon.
Keep stirring, and when the onions are deep
yellow, which should be in about eight
minutes, the dish is ready.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Potatoes.</p>

<p>Boil half a dozen potatoes in their skins.
Peel them when hot, cut them in quarters,
roll them in bread-crumbs, and then fry them
for seven minutes in two tablespoons of
sizzling butter. Sprinkle chopped parsley on
them before serving.</p>

<p>The tomato or love-apple is a perennial
joy to the eye, whether cooked or uncooked,
ripe or unripe. Its form and colour are alike
exquisite, and its flavour altogether a thing
apart. Our grandfathers knew little or
nothing about it, apart from sauce, and it
has been left to our generation fully to appreciate
its possibilities. It is the more
strange because it has been a staple article
of food in mid and southern Europe since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
time immemorial. It has even been suggested
that Eve’s apple, Paris’ apple, Nausicaa’s
apple, and the apples of Hesperides
were all really tomatoes! As <i>pommes d’amour</i>,
<i>pomi di mori</i>, <i>Liebesäpfel</i>, <i>Paradiesäpfel</i>, or
tomatoes, they are nowadays honoured and
appreciated by all right lovers of the good
things of the earth. They are both fruit
and vegetable, and it is very difficult to
spoil them in cooking. They are best of
all when grilled as an accompaniment to
chops (Mr. Pickwick, it will be remembered,
enjoyed them in the form of sauce), but the
following is a very simple and honest way of
preparing them.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Tomatoes.</p>

<p>Cut three tomatoes in halves. Pepper and
salt them and coat the cut surfaces with bread-crumbs.
Put two tablespoons of butter in
the Chafing Dish, and when sizzling add the
tomatoes and cook them thoroughly for eight
minutes.</p>

<p>The Jerusalem artichoke should not be
devoted solely to soup. It is an excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
adjunct to meats, and fully repays a little
careful attention.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Artichoke Chips.</p>

<p>Wash and peel the outer skin of a pound
of artichokes, then with a very sharp knife
peel them into ribbons (as one would peel an
apple); then put them lightly in a cloth to
dry. Hot up two tablespoons of olive oil in
the Chafer to smoking-point. Put in the
artichokes, letting them fry until they rustle
when stirred with a fork. Pour off the oil
and strain them. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper.</p>


<p class="sec">Braised Artichokes.</p>

<p>Wash and peel a pound of artichokes and
put them aside in a basin of cold water.
Melt a walnut of butter in the Chafing Dish;
add the artichokes after drying them well.
Let them brown well in the butter; add
pepper and salt and stir them frequently,
letting them simmer for twelve minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Spinach Purée.</p>

<p>Have your spinach thoroughly well washed
in several waters till it is perfectly clean.
Boil a pint of water in the Chafing Dish,
salt it and put in the spinach. Boil it for
ten minutes. Take out the spinach and
strain it. Pour cold water over it to take
away the bitter taste; strain again. Put a
walnut of butter in the dish, add the spinach
and half a cupful of milk. Mix up well
with a wooden spoon. Heat for five
minutes.</p>

<p>There are about twenty-five different kinds
of edible mushrooms. The popular test of
peeling is unreliable, because some poisonous
mushrooms peel easily, and some harmless
kinds do not. An authority on mushrooms
(Mr. E. Kay Robinson) says: “If a mushroom
of any kind which has been gathered from an
open space is brittle and compact in texture,
and not brightly coloured, nor peculiar in taste
or unpleasant in smell, and neither exudes a
milky juice when bruised, nor changes colour
when exposed to the air, you may eat it without
fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Consequently, when you go mushroom-gathering
you must bear in mind nearly as
many things as when you address your ball
on the tee. I always buy my mushrooms,
and go to a good shop; then, I think, you
are fairly safe.</p>

<p>The onion is a sure poison detector. Put
an onion in a dish of mushrooms. If it does
not change colour the mushrooms are all
right. If it blushes black with shame at its
contiguity, they are all wrong. A silver spoon
acts in the same way and gets black in contact
with toadstools or the like. Verily, evil
communications corrupt good manners—even
in onions.</p>


<p class="sec">Stewed Mushrooms.</p>

<p>Flood the Chafing Dish with really good
olive oil. Put in a teaspoonful of Paprika
and a pinch of salt. Drop in the mushrooms,
after having stalked and peeled them, black
part uppermost. Cover up, and listen to
the appetising sizzling for seven minutes.
They should then be done to a turn.</p>

<p>Mushrooms used to be dried, powdered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and used as a flavouring in the eighteenth
century. Cook-books of that period speak
of the condiment as “Cook’s Snuff.” The
great and justly esteemed Grimod de la
Reynière said that it ought always to be on
the dining-table together with pepper and
salt. Here is a hint for the modern purveyors
of table delicacies.</p>

<p>In Sir Henry Layard’s Essay on “Renaissance
Cookery,” he says: “Amongst vegetables,
the thistle (Cardo) was esteemed a
delicacy, and was generally served with fruit
at the end of the dinner. The thorny thistles
with well-grown white stalks are the best.”
The Cardo includes the artichoke, but that
the name was usually applied to the common
thistle is shown by the quaint remark of
Romoli in his “Singolare Dottrina,” that “it
should not be eaten with milk, which it has
the property of curdling, and consequently
the process would take place in your stomach,
but it should be eaten with pepper, which
does not generate wind, and clears the liver;
and such is the reason why donkeys, who eat
largely of this, have better stomachs than
men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Thudichum, an eminent authority on
dietetics, does not agree with these conclusions,
which are nevertheless illuminating,
and do not detract from the merits of the
nettle as a food-stuff.</p>


<p class="sec">Welsh Leeks.</p>

<p>Boil half a dozen leeks in a pint of water.
Drain them well, and cut each leek into two-inch
lengths; squeeze a lemon over them,
pepper and salt them well. Set them aside.
Make half a dozen croûtons of toast and
put the leeks on them. Replace them in
the Chafing Dish, pouring over each croûton
a liberal dose of Sauce Robert. Heat up
and serve on a very hot plate. Sauce Robert
(Escoffier brand) can be bought ready made
at the Stores.</p>


<p class="sec">French Beans.</p>

<p>Boil a pound of shredded beans till tender,
and then drain them well. Melt two tablespoons
of butter in the Chafing Dish and
stir into it a small dessert-spoon of flour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Keep these simmering, and shake them about
till they are lightly browned; add salt and
pepper and a cup of milk. Just before
serving, add the yolks of two eggs, slightly
beaten, and a squeeze of lemon. Stir all up
thoroughly and beat up to just below boiling-point.</p>


<p class="sec">Broad Beans.</p>

<p>Shell and wash in cold water one pint of
broad beans. Put them in the Chafing Dish
and boil them with a sprinkling of salt;
when nearly soft strain them, and then
replace them in the dish with a tumbler of
bouillon, a little chopped parsley, and a lump
of sugar. Cook them slowly until they are
quite tender. Beat up the yolk of an egg
and a wine-glass of milk; add both to the
beans with pepper and salt, and beat up
thoroughly to just below boiling-point.</p>


<p class="sec">Italian Broad Beans.</p>

<p>Shell a pint of fresh young broad beans
and put them aside in a dish of cold water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Fill the Chafing Dish with nearly two pints
of water, add a thick slice of cooked ham,
a stick of celery, a bunch of parsley, three
cloves, twenty peppercorns, and a bay leaf.
Boil all this for seven minutes, then remove
the ham, vegetables, and spices, and put in
the beans. When they are quite tender,
take them out, strain them, put them back
in the dish; add a tablespoon of butter, and
hot them up again for three or four minutes
before serving.</p>


<p class="sec">Brussels Sprouts.</p>

<p>Place a pint of small Brussels sprouts in
the Chafing Dish with two pints of boiling
water, slightly salted. Boil for ten minutes;
take out the sprouts, drain them and put
them aside to keep hot. Then make the
following sauce in the Chafing Dish. Two
tablespoons of butter melted, one tablespoon
flour, pepper and salt, and sufficient bouillon
to make the mixture of the consistency
of thick cream. Heat this to boiling,
stirring it well. Just before serving, add
the juice of a whole lemon. Pour the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
sauce over the hot sprouts, and serve very
quickly.</p>

<p>Both this and the previous recipe are
adapted from a most excellent book on the
cooking of vegetables: “Leaves from our
Tuscan Garden,” by Janet Ross.</p>


<p class="sec">Haricot Beans.</p>

<p>Put a pint of young green shelled haricot
beans into the Chafing Dish with two pints
of boiling water. When half cooked add
salt and pepper and a tablespoon of butter.
Take out the beans, drain them, and replace
them in the dish with another tablespoon of
butter, a little chopped parsley, more salt
and pepper and a squeeze of lemon. Toss
them about well in the Chafing Dish and hot
up for eight minutes.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Parsley.</p>

<p>Indispensable for flavourings. Wash the
parsley thoroughly, pick off the stalks,
leaving the large heads. Dry it very carefully
as, if it is left at all damp, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
never become crisp. Put the parsley in the
Chafing Dish with a tablespoon of olive oil
or butter. As soon as the oil or butter
ceases bubbling, take out the parsley and let
it dry on a piece of paper. The parsley
should remain quite green; if it is brownish
it is a sign that it has been fried too
long.</p>


<p class="sec">Green Peas.</p>

<p>A pint of shelled peas, a tablespoon of
butter, pepper and salt, and a good squeeze
of lemon; put all these in the Chafing Dish.
Add a cupful of milk and hot up for ten
minutes, then strain and serve. Avoid mint,
green or otherwise.</p>


<p class="sec">Chestnuts.</p>

<p>Shell a score of chestnuts, cover them in
the Chafing Dish with boiling water, and in
four minutes take them out and remove the
skins. Return them to the boiling water,
add a cup of milk, pepper and salt, and
simmer until quite tender but not soft.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>It has been made plain, I trust, that it is
not necessary to rely solely on the damp-sodden
vegetables of the pre-historic cuisine.
It is just as easy to cook them nicely as
otherwise, and a deal more satisfactory. The
bounteous housewife Nature overwhelms us
with her treasures of root and sap, and it
seems almost an outrage to neglect the
opportunities so lavishly offered to us.</p>

<p>I have just described a score or so of the
plainer methods of cooking vegetables, simply
as an indication of their possibilities, but the
enterprising Chafer will find as he progresses
in the art (and Chafing grows upon one like
any other hobby) that there are dozens of
others which lend themselves readily to his,
or her, deft manipulation.</p>

<p>The grandfather of Charles Darwin was a
poet of parts, and in his “Phytologica” he says:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oft in each month, poetic Tighe! be thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To dish green broccoli with savoury chine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft down thy tuneful throat be thine to cram</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The snow-white cauliflower with fowl and ham!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>This is wise advice, because the green
broccoli is far better than the white.</p>

<p>There are many American vegetables which
may be cooked without a twang. They are
all in tins or bottles, bearing plain directions.
Among others I can speak from personal
experience of Sugar Corn, Green Corn,
Oyster Corn, Boston Beans, Lima Beans, and
Succotash. This last is a meal in itself, and
of most excellent flavour and convenience.
Green corn, too, reminds those who know
the South African mealie in all its toothsomeness,
of many a hearty supper of Kaffir
mealies roasted in the embers of a camp fire,
or even in that most primitive of ovens, an
ant-heap, which, believe it or not as you will,
turns out better cooked meats than some of
your very patent, very modern, very “gadgetty”
kitchen ranges, although not better,
I ween, than my chaste Chaffinda.</p>

<p>From vegetables to salads is but one step.
I do not see any valid reason for apologising
for the inclusion of salads in a Chafing-Dish
book. They are not cooked in a Chafing
Dish, it is true, but it is part of my religion
that no meal is complete without a salad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
green for choice, but anyhow a salad. I do
not insist on salad for breakfast, although on
a blazing hot July day, after a swim or a
tramp, or both, I can imagine worse things
than an omelette, some kidneys and bacon,
and a slice of real ham, and a green salad to
top up with. But no dinner is really a
dinner without a salad, and by that I do not
mean three scraggy lettuce leaves, soused in
vinegar, which as <i>Salade de saison</i> is the usual
accompaniment to that disastrous hen, <i>Poulet
au cresson</i>, which is a centipede as to legs and
has no breast or liver wing.</p>

<p>As this screed is, after all, a plain record
of personal likes and dislikes, I see no reason
for concealing the fact that I have no use
whatever, no manner of use in the wide wide
world, for mayonnaise with salad. The
Americans swear by it; I swear at it. My
salad mixture, which goes with everything—absolutely
everything—is simplicity itself.
<i>Eccolo!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Salad Mixture.</p>

<p>Into a large bowl put half a teaspoon of
salt, same of Paprika, a dash of black pepper,
freshly ground by a hand-mill, and a teaspoon
of made English mustard. Mix them
up well. Now add very gradually the very
best quality of olive oil, almost drop by drop,
to the quantity of three tablespoons, mixing
all the time until the ingredients assume
the consistency of cream; now thin this
with one tablespoon of good wine vinegar,
and amalgamate thoroughly. That is all I
use.</p>

<p>Now and again, by way of extra titillation
of the jaded palate, you may add half a
tablespoon of Tarragon vinegar, herbs to
taste, Spring onions, chives, French mustard,
olives (French only), hard-boiled eggs, dandelion
leaves, nasturtium leaves, and celery
salt.</p>

<p>But there are half a dozen rules which I
would seriously enjoin the salad mixer to
bear in mind.</p>

<p>Only use a wooden spoon and fork for
mixing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Never cut a lettuce; always break it with
the fingers.</p>

<p>Dry the lettuce thoroughly in a serviette
or in a salad-basket before breaking.</p>

<p>Make the salad ten minutes before eating
it. Neither more nor less.</p>

<p>Do not bother about garnishing the top of
a salad; see the ingredients are well mixed.
The decoration will look after itself and be
much more artistic if left natural than if
fussed into geometrical designs.</p>

<p>Make your mixture proportionate to your
salad. This is a matter of intuition and
experience combined. The test of right
mixing is that no fluid should remain at the
bottom of the bowl when finally mixed.</p>

<p>The “fatiguing” or turning over and
over, that is, the actual mixing of the salad,
should be very thoroughly done for just as
long as is bearable to the verge of impatience.
Rub a crust of bread with garlic or onion,
put it in the bottom of the bowl and take it
out just before serving. This is a <i>chapon</i>.</p>

<p>The true salad artist will never add any
second dose of any ingredient during the
process of mixing the sauce. I was once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
present at a salad duel between an eminent
Belgian violoncellist and a British banker.
The former was an artist, the latter a well-meaning
amateur. They used the same
cruet-stand, and during the mixing process
the banker politely pushed the oil and
vinegar across to the Belgian, who bowed
and said: “Thanks. I never add!” The
banker appreciated the rebuke and retired
from the contest. Both salads were excellent.</p>

<p>The old salad-proverb about the oil-spendthrift,
the vinegar-miser, and all the
rest of it, is too old to quote, but it
expresses a truism aptly enough. Three to
one is, according to my view, a fair proportion
of oil to vinegar, but this, as indeed
most things in this so-called twentieth century
of ours, is only a matter of individual
taste, and I have no desire to suggest that
my opinion should be given the force of law.
I have known a salad enthusiast who coated
each leaf of lettuce with oil on a camel’s-hair
brush, but this I think is an exaggeration
of artistry. On the other hand, the
wild stirring of dollops of the four condiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
.in the salad spoon, which is then
emptied vaguely into the salad, is childish
and inefficient. The Italians have a proverb
that runs:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>L’insalata non è buon’ ne bella</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Ove non è la pimpinella.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The pimpernel is our burnet.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to give full recipes
for all the following salads. I have already
indicated the mixture, and the choice of
ingredients need only be hinted at.</p>

<p>Lettuce should be young, fresh, and crisp.
There are many varieties, the most delicate
of which perhaps is the Romaine.</p>

<p>Endive is good when quite young. It
should be very light in colour. Do not mix
it with lettuce. A few dandelion leaves are
quite permissible.</p>

<p>Chicory makes an excellent salad, and
radishes mix well with it.</p>

<p>Celery and Parmesan cheese go well together.
The celery must be cut into half-inch
pieces.</p>

<p>Cauliflower, cooked and cold, mixed with
celery, or a very few slices of cold cooked
carrot, is cool and pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Tomatoes and lettuce go well together,
and onions are a good addition.</p>

<p>Potato salad requires firm round little
potatoes cooked, cold, and cut into slices.
The best kind is known as Hamburg Potatoes,
and they may be had at the German
Delikatessen shops. Avoid anchovies and
olives with potato salad, but encourage
chives and a sprinkling of cheese.</p>


<p class="sec">Celeriac.</p>

<p>This is a variety of celery, sometimes
known as Dutch celery, a tuber which has a
quite peculiar and characteristic flavour. It
needs no addition whatever, and is an
excellent accompaniment to all meats. Cut
it in slices, after boiling it for twelve
minutes, and mix carefully with plenty of
liquid.</p>


<p class="sec">Mashed Potato Salad.</p>

<p>Beat up ordinary mashed potatoes with a
little lukewarm weak stock or warm water
instead of milk, and no butter. Then dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
them with a little chopped chive, oil and
vinegar, pepper and salt. This can be
endlessly varied with chopped hard-boiled
eggs, beetroot, cucumbers, anchovies, &amp;c.
This salad comes from that most excellent
compendium of quaint conceits, “More Potpourri
from a Surrey Garden,” by Mrs. C.
W. Earle.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned salads, according to a seventeenth-century
cook-book, were more diversified
than ours. Among the ingredients of
“Grand Sallets of divers compounds” were
broom buds, pickled mushrooms, pickled
oysters, blew figs, Virginia potato, caperons,
crucifix pease, sage, mint, balm, burnet,
violet leaves, red coleworts, raisins of the
sun, charvel and ellicksander buds. Some of
these we know under other names, but
“blew figs” and “ellicksander buds” are
untraceable. The list has a Rabelaisian
smack, and gives one some idea of the crude
admixture of flavourings which was acceptable
to our forebears.</p>

<p>In a very charming old book, “Travels in
England in 1702,” by C. P. Moritz, a
Prussian clergyman, the following passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
seems quotable: “An English dinner generally
consists of a piece of half-boiled, or
half-roasted, meat; and a few cabbage leaves
boiled in plain water; on which they pour a
sauce made of flour and butter. This, I
assure you, is the usual method of dressing
vegetables in England. The slices of bread
and butter which they give you with your
tea are as thin as poppy leaves. But there is
another kind of bread and butter usually
eaten with tea, which is toasted by the fire,
and is incomparably good. You take one
slice after the other, and hold it to the fire
on a fork till the butter is melted, so that it
penetrates a number of slices at once; this is
called toast.”</p>

<p>Another part of the same book describes
the kitchen in a country inn, and gives a
picture which seems to describe some old
Dutch interior. “I now, for the first time,
found myself in one of these kitchens which
I had so often read of in Fielding’s fine
novels; and which certainly give one, on
the whole, a very accurate idea of English
manners. The chimney, in this kitchen,
where they were roasting and boiling, seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to be taken off from the rest of the room,
and enclosed by a wooden partition, the rest
of the apartment was made use of as a
sitting and eating room. All round on the
sides were shelves with pewter dishes and
plates, and the ceiling was well stored with
provisions of various kinds, such as sugar-loaves,
black puddings, hams, sausages,
flitches of bacon, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>A modern Dr. Syntax in search of the
picturesque would vainly nowadays look for
anything approaching this homely simplicity
in any English hostelry. The modern tendency
seems all directed towards spurious
finery, meretricious decoration, and uncomfortable
New Art. The old inns are
neglected, and the new hotels merely vulgarly
gorgeous. The food is ambitious and
basely imitative of bad French models. The
advent of the ubiquitous motor car on old
country roads, away from the railways, may
in time improve matters, and revive, to a
certain extent, the extinct glories of the old
coaching inns; but as yet there is little, if
any, improvement to be marked. In the
meanwhile, I would suggest that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
travelling motor car be provided with a
Chafing Dish, and thus mitigate or improve
the dull pretentious meals which the country
hotel proprietor thinks proper to provide.
The Chafing Dish and the motor car seem
made for one another. Will somebody try
the combination?</p>

<p>There are just a few more salads which I
should like to recommend, premising, however,
that they are not altogether orthodox.
By this I mean that they are not wholly composed
of greenstuffs, but require the addition
of extraneous appetisers.</p>


<p class="sec">Walnuts and Green Peas.</p>

<p>Boil and blanch a dozen walnuts; break
them in halves, mix them with a pint of
green peas, cooked and cold, and toss them
about in a small quantity of dressing.</p>


<p class="sec">Sprouts and Chestnuts.</p>

<p>Boil and skin a dozen chestnuts. Break
them up and mix with a pint of cold cooked
Brussels sprouts. Toss them in a small
amount of mixture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Jardinière.</p>

<p>Almost any cold cooked vegetables. For
choice, use equal portions of sliced potatoes,
green peas, carrots, beans, celery, tomatoes,
and onions. Add plenty of dressing.</p>


<p class="sec">Cucumbers and Anchovies.</p>

<p>Wash, scrape and dry the anchovies. Chop
them up. Have the cucumber thinly sliced
and thoroughly drained; plenty of salt, and
little mixture. Sprinkle the anchovies over
the sliced cucumber.</p>


<p class="sec">Cauliflower and Bacon.</p>

<p>Dry the cauliflower and break up into
small pieces, using all the flower and very
little stalk or green. Cut a couple of slices
of bacon into dice, sprinkle it about in the
cauliflower, and use plenty of dressing.</p>


<p class="sec">Bread Salad.</p>

<p>Cut three slices of stale bread (crumb
only) into half-inch squares; same amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
of sliced cold cooked potatoes; three tomatoes
in quarters, one onion; toss all well
together with a good deal of dressing. This
sounds very simple, but as Sam Weller’s
pieman said, “It’s the seasoning as does it.”</p>

<p>Lest I be thought quite unspeakably impossible
in these last recipes, let me assure
the worthy sceptics that they are in no wise
guess-work, but one and all duly approved,
and that I have merely taken the trouble to
collate them and set them down here. They
are excellent and original. I think that many
folks will be grateful for them.</p>

“The vulgar boil, the learned roast an egg.”<br>
<span class="smcap pad1">Pope.</span>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the name of the profit: Eggs! Although
farming in England may spell ruin, poultry
almost always pays, and if intelligently and
economically managed, one rarely hears of
the failure of a poultry-farm. We import a
vast number of millions of eggs annually
(many of which come to a deservedly unrighteous
end in villainous omelettes), but it
would be easy, with capital, initiative, and
incubators, to produce them one and all in
Great Britain and make the egg trade a
national industry.</p>

<p>A couple of generations ago, when any one
walked gingerly in the street, he or she was
said to be going at an “egg-trot,” because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
reminded one of a good housewife riding to
market at a jog-trot pace with eggs in her
panniers. Let us therefore approach the
subject of eggs at an “egg-trot.”</p>

<p>A good egg is never bad. That is not
such an inept truism as it looks. A good
egg is unspoilable, even by the worst cook.
There are over four hundred and fifty ways
of cooking eggs, each of which has some
peculiar excellence denied to the others. You
cannot even make an omelette without breaking
eggs, and most people find breakfast
almost impossible without the regulation
hen-fruit. To teach one’s grandmother how
to suck eggs is a futile labour partaking of
juvenile presumption, but it is at least easier
than persuading the average cook that the
fried egg of commerce is only one out of
scores of simple breakfast egg-dishes.
“There is reason in roasting eggs.” Even
the most trivial culinary conjuring trick has
some good motive for being performed in
one way rather than in another. When
wood fires were usual it was more common
to roast eggs than to boil them, and great
care was required to prevent their being “ill-roasted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
all on one side,” as Touchstone says
in the play. Which is an additional reason
for keeping strictly to the formula. Eggs
are ticklish things to monkey with, and it is
much easier to break them than to make
them.</p>

<p>Learned disquisitions have before now
been written on “How to boil an egg.” It
is not in my province to touch on that
subject. The votary of the Chafing Dish
may be presumed to have enough common
sense to come in out of the rain, and to be
able to boil an egg. It is not much to ask.
Pope, by the way, thought it vulgar to boil
an egg, but then we are all vulgar nowadays—and
glory in it. Neither do I propose to
expatiate upon egg-flip, egg-nog, and kindred
“dulceties.” I will give a few plain straightforward
recipes for eggs in the Chafing Dish,
and leave egg-eccentricities to my betters. I
have only to premise that there is but one
kind of egg. The Best. Real new-laid
eggs are reliable friends. All others are base
impostors!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Poached Eggs.</p>

<p>The Chafing Dish should be more than
half full of boiling water. Break each egg
separately into a saucer and slip it steadily
and dexterously into the Chafing Dish.
Light the lamp, cover up the water and eggs,
and put the dish over the lower hot-water
pan, which should have in it a pint of hot
water. Let it heat until the whites of the
eggs are set; then remove the eggs from the
pan with the special flat implement <i>ad hoc</i>.
Put the eggs on rounds of toast. Sprinkle
them with pepper, salt and parsley, and put
a tiny piece of butter on top of each egg.</p>


<p class="sec">Scrambled Eggs.</p>

<p>Beat up three eggs, whites and yolks, in a
bowl, and add a pinch of salt. Put a good
tablespoon of butter in the Chafing Dish,
over a pan of hot water. When the butter
sizzles, pour in the eggs, and stir with a
wooden spoon very briskly for a minute and
a half to two minutes, keeping the eggs
from adhering to the sides and bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Dish. Have rounds of toast ready, and pour
the eggs on to them. Dust them with
Paprika and parsley.</p>

<p>It is easy and pleasant to vary plain
scrambled eggs with a dozen odds and ends.
Asparagus tips, for instance, bacon dice, tiny
slicelets of ham, green peas, thin rounds of
Brunswick sausage, broad beans, chicken
livers, button mushrooms, tomatoes, or
chopped nasturtium leaves. All these should
be added, cooked of course, towards the end
of the stirring operation, and just before
serving. Many other ingredients might be
suggested, but the ingenious innovator will
be able to think these out for himself, and he
can always christen his invention scrambled
eggs <i>à la quelque chose</i> to please his own fancy
and flatter his friends.</p>


<p class="sec">Omelettes.</p>

<p>An omelette should not be too lightly
undertaken. There are few things more
tricky, more unreliable, more human, in a
sense, than an omelette. You may make it
a dozen times with perfect success. It will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
be light, frothy, ethereal, almost gossamer-like
in its impalpable fairyhood. The
thirteenth time you proceed on precisely the
same lines, use the same material, and in
every way follow the same formula, and the
result is chaos. If there be a sex in cookery,
omelettes must be essentially feminine.</p>

<p>This is how to make an omelette. Beat
three eggs lightly with two tablespoons of
milk, a little salt and pepper. Put one
tablespoon of butter in the Chafing Dish
over the hot-water pan, and when sizzling
hot, pour in the eggs. You must hold the
dish in the left hand, and rapidly scrape
away with a knife the cooked egg where
it seems to adhere, letting the liquid portion
follow the knife. It should be cooked in
less than fifty seconds if the water beneath
it is boiling. Then gently, but firmly, slip
the knife under the left-hand edge of the
omelette and fold it over rapidly and neatly
to the side of the dish opposite the handle.
Have a very hot plate ready; reverse it on
to the dish, turn the latter over the former
quickly, and the omelette will (or should)
rest on the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Of course all this sounds very easy, but
it needs knack and practice—lots of both.
When entirely successful, however, it is most
gratifying and self-flattering. You feel a
real cook at last, and look upon Ude,
Carême, Francatelli, and the other great
names of history as brothers. All Chafers
go through that pleasant period when all
goes right and nothing goes wrong. Sometimes
it lasts quite a while; but at last,
sooner or later, there comes a moment when
we know we feel that we know how little
we know. As at golf, when we never play
so well as during our first month, even so
is it with Chaffinda.</p>

<p>The testing of eggs should not rightly be
one of the Chafer’s duties. He should be
able to rely on his purveyor. The best eggs
I ever had in London were provided by an
old landlady who told me that she got them
twice a week from the country. When I
asked her what county they came from, she
said, “They come all the way from Clapham
Junction, sir!” Anyhow, they were remarkably
good, and I have been served with
less reliable ones in country farmhouses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
This was possibly for the same reason that
one can rarely get fish at the seaside until
the London train comes in.</p>


<p class="sec">Eggs en Cocotte.</p>

<p>You must provide some of those dear
little fireproof china cups especially made
for the purpose. Butter these little cups.
Put two teaspoonsful of cream into each.
Then break very carefully an egg into each.
Dust with pepper, salt, and parsley. Stand
these cups in the Chafing Dish with enough
boiling water to come half-way up the cups.
Have the lower pan full of hot water underneath.
Boil up gently till the eggs are just
set. Serve in the cups very hot, taking care
in hauling them out of the Chafing Dish as
they are very easily dropped.</p>


<p class="sec">Lady Effingham’s Eggs.</p>

<p>Put two slices of Gruyère cheese (not very
thin) in the Chafing Dish with a tablespoon
of butter. Break two eggs in a saucer and
slide them on to the cheese; sprinkle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
salt and Paprika and let it simmer (over the
hot-water pan) till the eggs are set. Serve
with fingers of toast.</p>


<p class="sec">Newmarket Eggs.</p>

<p>Put a tablespoon of butter in the Chafing
Dish. When it sizzles add an onion cut
into slices; let it get well browned. Then
throw in three fair-sized potatoes in slices.
Pour over these the well-beaten yolks of two
eggs, adding salt and pepper. Heat up to
boiling-point. Serve with toast.</p>


<p class="sec">Kempton Eggs.</p>

<p>Cut into slices three hard-boiled eggs
and one onion; put the latter only in the
Chafing Dish with a tablespoon of butter.
Stir it, and fry the onion to a light brown,
then sprinkle in half a tablespoon of flour,
and add two tablespoons of milk, pepper
and salt. Boil up and then add the
eggs; serve at once with grated Parmesan
cheese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Anchovy Eggs.</p>

<p>Place a tablespoon of butter in the Chafing
Dish, add half a teaspoon of dry mustard,
two tablespoons of tomato sauce, one of
Worcester sauce, and one of mushroom
ketchup. Let it simmer, and then drop in
four hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, salted
and peppered. Prepare four rounds of toast,
spread them with good anchovy paste, or,
better still, with Patum Peperium, and put
the eggs on the toast, pouring over them
the mixture.</p>

<p>This a remarkably good dish after a dance
in the country and a ten-mile drive home.
If the proper preparations are made, it can
be turned out in five minutes in the billiard-room,
and it picks one up in a thoroughly
businesslike and efficient manner. Those
cold winter drives after a busy night’s
dancing, especially if the supper was good
and frequent, demand a powerful restorative.</p>

<p>Now come we to the great question of
Welsh Rabbit. I venture to doubt whether
Rarebit is defensible, and I have read shoals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of arguments for and against. Anyhow, my
kind is a Rabbit, and it tastes as nice—or
nicer.</p>

<p>A small boy walking across a common
with his mother espied a bunny. “Look,
mother, there goes a rabbit!” “Nonsense,
my boy, it must have been imagination.”
“Mother, is imagination white behind?”</p>

<p>There is no imagination about a Welsh
Rabbit. It is sternly real. But not, I
think, quite as indigestible as generally supposed,
especially if it be liberally dosed with
Paprika, which I find to be marvellously
digestive. A well-made Rabbit should be
suave in flavour, not harsh, stringy, or pungent.
There should be a silky sensation of
sensuous softness, and, above all things, it
should not tickle the palate. I fear that
I am led to dogmatise on the rabbit, and
to ferret out my own didactic ideas on the
subject, but if my rabbit be carefully concocted
and intelligently degustated, I am
convinced that I shall be forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Welsh Rabbit.</p>

<p>Use about half a pound of hard, dry,
sound, mild cheese, without flaw or speck.
Cut it up into tiny dice, in fact the smaller
the better; some indeed insist on grating
the cheese, but I have found this to be an
unnecessary labour. Put a tablespoon of
butter into the dish and knead it well with
a wooden spoon until it begins to sizzle.
Add half a teaspoon of Paprika, rather less
of salt, and a tablespoon of beer (anything
except bitter). Mix all thoroughly. Turn
in the cheese and stir it about until it gets
as consistent as thick cream, adding two to
three more tablespoons of beer gradually,
and taking great care that it does not become
lumpy or stringy. Now put in a teaspoonful
of made mustard. Keep on stirring
until bubbles appear. It is then ready.
You should beforehand get some toasts
ready and as soon as the bubbling is well
developed plunge in the toasts and cover
them with the cheese. Serve on very hot
plates. Milk can be used instead of beer,
and condiments may be added in the shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of Worcester sauce or Tabasco, but I do
not recommend them. Everything depends
on regular and practically continuous stirring,
always in one direction of course.</p>

<p>If you want to turn the Welsh Rabbit into
a Buck Rabbit, drop a poached egg upon
each piece of toast on top of the cheese.
Here you have the whole art of Rabbiting,
and it is a very good thing to eat—sometimes.</p>

<p>The right and only place for Savouries
at a dinner-party is fixed and determined by
immutable custom, but at a Chafing-Dish
meal, be it luncheon or supper, more latitude
is allowed, and a savoury may pop up here
and there at the most unexpected—and
thereby most delightful—moment. I see
nothing heterodox in having a savoury
instead of <i>hors d’œuvres</i>, or introducing it
after the fish or instead of sweets. Few
people, and those only of the baser sort,
despise a simple savoury. It is such a
succulent trifle, a mere mouthful of suggestion,
an airy nothing that agrees with everything.
There are of course savouries and
savouries. I can only give a very few recipes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
but have tried to make them as diverse and
appetising as possible.</p>


<p class="sec">Ham Toast.</p>

<p>A quarter of a pound of lean ham,
chopped fine. Do not mince it. Mincing
machines, however patent and “adjustable,”
have a way of reducing everything to an
unholy pulp. Put the ham in the Chafing
Dish with a teaspoon of Worcester sauce,
half a teaspoon of good curry powder (I
like Ventacachellum’s), a small tablespoon of
butter, three drops of Tabasco, and two
tablespoons of milk. Mix all well, heat up
for five minutes and then spread on hot
fingers of toast.</p>


<p class="sec">Cheese Matador.</p>

<p>Put a walnut of butter into the Chafing
Dish, also a Spanish onion sliced. Simmer
for three minutes. Then cut a quarter of a
pound of hard dry cheese into dice, and
drop into the mixture; add half a cup of
milk and stir well till it is all thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
amalgamated and the cheese melted; add
salt and Paprika and one beaten-up egg.
Hot up for another three minutes and serve
with toast.</p>


<p class="sec">Savoury Biscuits.</p>

<p>Mix up the yolks of two eggs and two
tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese. You
can buy this ready grated, but it is not as
good as if you grate it yourself. Add half
a teaspoon of mustard and some salt. Spread
the mixture on thinly buttered water biscuit
(or thin Captains), put the biscuits in the
Chafing Dish, over boiling water, and let
them get slowly hot.</p>


<p class="sec">Braised Olives.</p>

<p>Stone neatly a dozen Spanish olives. Put
them in the Chafing Dish with enough strong
bouillon to cover them. Add a wine-glass
of claret and the rind of half a lemon.
Boil up quickly, strain, and serve the olives
on toast or heated biscuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Bombay Toast.</p>

<p>A tablespoon of butter in the Chafing
Dish; as it melts stir in two eggs, yolks and
whites, half a teaspoon of Paprika, the same
of anchovy sauce, and half a dozen capers,
chopped up. When very hot spread this
upon rounds of buttered toast.</p>


<p class="sec">Devilled Chestnuts.</p>

<p>Boil half a pound of chestnuts and remove
the shells and skins. Break them in handy
little lumps. When cold and hard return
them to the Chafing Dish and fry them in a
tablespoon of butter, half a teaspoon of
Paprika, and plenty of salt, until they are
well cooked through. Drain and dry them
on blotting-paper, and put a drop of Tabasco
on each lump.</p>


<p class="sec">Salted Almonds.</p>

<p>Melt one and a half tablespoons of butter.
Drop into it a quarter of a pound of blanched
almonds, and hot up till the almonds are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
well burned, brown but not black. Drain
them on blotting-paper and sprinkle them
with plenty of salt and a little Paprika.</p>


<p class="sec">The Devil.</p>

<p>One can devil bones, biscuits, meat and
fish in a Chafing Dish very nearly as well as
on the grill. Care must be taken always to
score the flesh across with deep incisions, so
that the devil mixture penetrates well into
the meat. This is the best devil mixture for
Chafing-Dish purposes that I know. There
may be better, but I have not come across
them. Mix well upon a plate a teaspoon of
mustard, the same of Worcester sauce and
anchovy sauce, two teaspoons of olive oil and
half a teaspoon of Paprika. Let the meat
soak up this mixture, and then hot it up in a
tablespoon of butter till it almost boils. A
chicken drumstick makes the best devil in
the world, but biscuits dipped in the mixture
are not to be despised, and even slices of cold
cooked meat, beef or mutton, are very toothsome
if treated in the same manner. Any
cold bird makes an excellent devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Macaroni.</p>

<p>Although it may not come quite strictly
under the head of Eggs and Savouries, this
seems about the right place to expatiate upon
Macaroni, the national food of Italy and the
delight of every cultivated nation.</p>

<p>Real macaroni is made of hard wheat of a
semi-translucent kind, which is richer in
gluten and other nitrogenous matter than
soft wheat. Macaroni is nothing but flour
and water mixed in a cylinder, which concocts
it into stiff paste. Then it is rolled
under a huge granite wheel which flattens it
into a smooth mass. It is cut into squares,
and flattened by the wheel again and again
until it is thoroughly kneaded. The dough
then goes into an upright metal cylinder
closed at the lower end with a thick disc of
copper. This is pierced with openings
through which a plunge-piston squeezes the
dough into threads. The threads are cut off
at regular intervals, and hung upon wooden
drying-rods. Real macaroni is tender, yellowish,
rough in texture, and elastic. It breaks
with a clean, porcelainlike fracture. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
it boils it swells to twice its size, and does
not become sticky, but keeps its tubular
form without collapse. It will keep any
length of time in a dry cool place.</p>

<p>There are many agreeable variations on
the macaroni theme, some of which suggest
music rather than cooking. Everybody
knows Vermicelli, but among the lesser
known but equally admirable kinds are
Tagliatelli, Lasagnete, Fuselli, Bicorni,
Candele, Cannelloni, Pennoni, Capelli di
Angelo, and many more. Each has its
own little special peculiarity. All are alike
excellent.</p>


<p class="sec">Tagliatelli.</p>

<p>Perhaps the handiest for Chafing-Dish
purposes is Tagliatelli. Boil two pints of
water in the Dish, put in half a pound of
Tagliatelli, boil eight minutes, then strain.
Return to the Dish, add a tablespoon of
grated Parmesan cheese, and the same of
butter. Toss round and round until well
mixed, and serve very hot. Tomatoes mix
well with macaroni, and so do mushrooms;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
but the real macaroni-lover will prefer it by
itself, accompanied always, of course, by
plenty of cheese. Mustard mixes well with
it, but be very chary of the salt, for it is
already salted during the process of preparation.
To make macaroni <i>au gratin</i>, which
seems (unaccountably enough) to be the only
way in which it is served in nine British
households out of ten, the top of the cooked
macaroni must be well covered with grated
Parmesan cheese, and then carefully browned
with a salamander.</p>


<p class="sec">Ravioli.</p>

<p>Another most useful Italian preparation is
Ravioli, which is compounded of a variety
of good things. As Leporello says in Don
Giovanni: “Madamina, il catalogo è questo!”
Eggs, Macaroni, Paste, Pork, Chicken,
Vegetables, and Cheese. It is a sort of
White Knight portmanteau food, and if
quite fresh (it is best in summer) is rightly
termed “A dinner in one course”—if you
cook it badly you may omit one letter in the
last word.</p>

<p>This is how to prepare Ravioli with the
help of Chaffinda. To two pints of boiling
water in the Chafing Dish put a quarter of a
pound of Ravioli; boil for ten minutes, then
strain. Return to the dish; add half a
teaspoon of butter, the same of grated
Parmesan cheese, and hot it up for three
minutes. Additional zest may be given,
though it is by no means necessary, by
cooking with the Ravioli a few fresh mushrooms,
tomatoes, or even anchovies or olives.
The best Ravioli I have found in London
come from the Vegetable Meal Company of
Soho.</p>

<p>With Macaroni or Ravioli I always suggest
the drinking of Chianti, or Lacrima
Christi. The former can often be obtained
of quite good quality, not too rough or fiery.
As to the latter, it is rare to find it drinkable.
As a rule it is impossible. But the combination
of food and wine is a good memory-reviver
of a week at Genoa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Madame de Staël</span> said that she did not
believe in ghosts—but that she was afraid of
them. After the same fashion, I do not altogether
believe in sauces, or perhaps I ought
to say in any save the very simplest; but I
fully recognise their great value in the assimilation
of food.</p>

<p>Many dishes, without their special sauces,
would be like a well-known song sung without
an accompaniment. However beautifully
delivered, no one, be he never so musical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
could honestly say that he enjoyed Schubert’s
“Erlkönig,” unaccompanied. The accompaniment
is so much a part of the artistic whole
that to separate them would be sheer vandalism.
Something of the same intimate
oneness exists in cookery. Who would care
to eat lamb divorced from mint sauce, or
boiled mutton without the necessary caper
sauce, or goose minus apple sauce?</p>

<p>At the same time it is a culinary axiom
that the less sauce used the better. A dish—any
dish—“covered in sauce” is an abomination.
We have the august authority of Pliny
for moderation and simplicity. “Their best
and most wholesome feeding is upon one
dish, and no more, and the same plaine and
simple: for surely this huddling of many
meats one upon another of divers tastes is
pestiferous. But sundrie sauces are more
dangerous than that.” This is Holland’s
translation.</p>

<p>Another point worthy of consideration is
that sauce is to a great extent a geographical
expression. What may be most excellent in
Madrid is wholly out of place in Inverness;
and what is nice at Nice is nasty at Norwich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Insufficient account, I venture to think,
is taken of the influence of climate upon
national food, and it is often difficult if not
impossible to acclimatise foreign fare to
British stomachs, not because of anything
inherent in the food, but simply as a matter
of latitude. It is an historical commonplace
that in the bleak cold north of Europe boar’s
flesh was found more to man’s taste than
that of the bull or bear, because it is fatter,
richer, and produces much more heat. For
this very reason in the South and East of
Europe the flesh of swine is an abomination.
In the Scandinavian Edda we are told that a
boar was killed every night for the food of
the warriors who feasted in high Valhalla.
The bones were all preserved, together with
the hide and head, and in the morning they
were put together and re-endowed with life.
The name of this huge pig was Sœhrimner,
the cauldron in which it was boiled was
called Eldhrimner, and the cook Andhrimner.</p>

<p>Both bear-ham and boar-ham are delicacies
to this day in the North of Europe.</p>

<p>Much depends, too, upon the cooking; bad
cooking is waste, both of money and comfort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Those whom God has joined in matrimony,
ill-cooked joints and worse-cooked potatoes
have often put asunder. In sauces, above
all things, careful cooking, implicit keeping
to the exact formulæ of recipes, and a restraint
of all imagination, are immensely
necessary. Not even the greatest artist can
afford to juggle with sauces. They are fixed,
immutable, and unalterable. A very favourite
expression in French culinary manuals is the
injunction to the cook: <i>Travaillez bien votre
sauce</i>. The amateur sauce-maker would do
well to bear this in mind. The sauce must
be well worked, amalgamated, combined;
otherwise it is a mere mess, lacking cohesion
and perfection.</p>

<p>It is alleged of the incomparable Soyer
that he said that sauces are to cookery what
grammar is to language. Whether he really
said so or not matters little. Some of the
Soyer sauces are classics to this day, and not
to be lightly imitated—especially on the
Chafing Dish.</p>

<p>Let it be borne in mind that each and
every sauce should have a character of its
own. Many otherwise quite virtuous cooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
live and die in the belief that they cannot
make a sauce sufficiently savoury without
putting into it everything that happens to be
available, thinking, ignorantly enough, that
every addition is bound to be an improvement.</p>

<p>There are only two real foundation sauces—<i>mères
sauces</i>, or <i>grandes sauces</i>, as the
French call them—the white and the brown
sauce. All other sauces are more or less
based on these two.</p>

<p>The great Carême resigned the position of
Master of the Mouth to George IV. after
only a few weeks’ service, and at an honorarium
of £1000 a year, because he could
not bear the English climate. His culinary
swan-song took the form of a wondrous
sauce, now alas! lost, which he called <i>la
dernière pensée de Carême</i>.</p>

<p>A quite excellent and easily prepared
sauce, which the very poorest households can
make, and which will give zest to the simplest
meal, is that described in the Delamere
Cookery Book. This is the recipe for Pleasant
Companionship sauce. A kind word
will stir up the dormant appetite, while a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
harsh one will extinguish it, and, what is worse,
will check the digestion of nutriment already
taken. Such sauce may be regarded as
Moral Sauce.</p>

<p>Reasoning from these winged words, we
may infer that the remark so often heard
from the mouths of little girl-children in
the street: “Now, I won’t ’ave none o’ your
sauce!” must really mean that there is a lack
of Moral Sauce in the family circle.</p>

<p>In the recipes for the following sauces, I
have purposely kept the ingredients as simple
as possible; they are all reliable and appetising.
As to which sauce appertains especially
to which fish or meat, I do not propose to
enter. That is a matter of taste, experience,
and individuality, and I need hardly add that
a white sauce does not go well with brown
meat, nor brown sauce with white meat.
Such admonitions are surely unnecessary to
the advanced Chafist.</p>


<p class="sec">Butter Sauce.</p>

<p>Two tablespoons of butter, the same of
flour; melt and mix together in the Dish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
bring to boiling-point and allow to boil up
for half a minute, then pour in a cupful of
boiling water, to reduce the same to the consistency
of cream; boil up again, stirring all
the time, add a squeeze of lemon before
serving.</p>


<p class="sec">White Sauce.</p>

<p>Mix well in the Chafing Dish two tablespoons
of flour, one of butter, a small grating
of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt; add a
tumbler of milk; hot it up, stirring the
while, and strain before using.</p>


<p class="sec">Brown Sauce.</p>

<p>Two tablespoons of butter. Heat and stir
until it is brown and sizzling, then add a
tablespoon of Tarragon vinegar, the same of
Worcester sauce, half a tablespoon of chopped
capers, a teaspoon of anchovy sauce, and a
wine-glass of bouillon. Boil up all this for
three minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Piquant Sauce.</p>

<p>Mix up in the Dish a teaspoon of each
of the following, chopped finely: gherkins,
capers, shallots (or mild onions); add half a
teaspoon of black pepper and a tablespoon of
vinegar. Boil this for three minutes, then
add a wine-glass of bouillon and a tablespoon
of “brown thickening”—which is sold ready
made by grocers—and a dash of anchovy
sauce. Boil up again and skim the surface
before using.</p>


<p class="sec">Maître d’Hôtel Sauce.</p>

<p>Mix up well two tablespoons of butter
with one of flour, a grating of nutmeg, half
a teaspoon of black pepper, the same of salt,
rather more of chopped parsley, and a good
squeeze of lemon. Put all this in the Chafing
Dish with a tablespoon of milk. Stir it until
it boils up, and then serve very hot.</p>


<p class="sec">Ravigote or Rémoulade Sauce.</p>

<p>These are to all intents and purposes the
same sauce, save that Rémoulade has an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
added dose of oil and mustard. Mix a
tablespoon of flour with the same of butter,
a grating of nutmeg, half a teaspoon of
pepper, the same of salt, the same of chopped
parsley, and a good squeeze of lemon. Put
this in the Chafing Dish with a tablespoon of
bouillon, boil it up and skim it. Now mix
up separately a tablespoon each of Tarragon
and Chili vinegar and Worcester sauce, with
a teaspoon of anchovy sauce. Boil up this
mixture, and after two minutes’ boiling
add it to the former mixture and combine
the two.</p>


<p class="sec">Reform Sauce.</p>

<p>A cupful of bouillon in the Dish, add a
wine-glass of port (or claret, but port is more
orthodox), half as much Worcester sauce, a
teaspoon of anchovy sauce, and a full tablespoon
of red currant jelly. Boil it all up for
three minutes, and skim before using.</p>


<p class="sec">Soubise Sauce.</p>

<p>Peel and slice four onions; put them in
the Dish with a teaspoon of butter, a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Cover up and stew
very slowly until the onions are almost dissolved.
Then add two tablespoons of flour,
a cold cooked potato cut into dice, a cupful
of bouillon, and the same of milk. Stir and
boil for three minutes. Then rub the sauce
through a sieve and hot up again before
serving.</p>


<p class="sec">Bread Sauce.</p>

<p>A tablespoon of bread-crumbs in the Dish
with an onion, pepper and salt, a cup of milk,
and half a tablespoon of butter. Hot up
and stir for four minutes. Take out the
onion before using.</p>


<p class="sec">Mustard Sauce.</p>

<p>To the foregoing plain butter sauce add a
teaspoon of made mustard, a tablespoon of
Chili vinegar, a squeeze of lemon, and a teaspoon
of anchovy sauce. Make and serve
very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Poor Man’s Sauce.</p>

<p>Chop up a fair-sized onion in the Chafing
Dish with half a tablespoon of butter. Fry
to a light brown, then add a cup of bouillon,
a teaspoon of vinegar, pepper and salt, and a
teaspoon of chopped parsley. Stir vigorously
and add gradually half a tablespoon of flour,
and another half-tablespoon of butter. Boil
up the sauce for two minutes.</p>


<p class="sec">Madeleine Sauce.</p>

<p>Put in the Dish a teaspoon of bread-crumbs,
two shredded shallots, a walnut of butter, a
teaspoon of vinegar and two tablespoons of
bouillon. Boil this for three minutes with
pepper and salt. The sauce should not be
too thick.</p>


<p class="sec">Black Butter Sauce.</p>

<p>A walnut of butter in the dish; heat it
till it is thoroughly brown, then add a tablespoon
of vinegar, pepper and salt, and hot it
up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Italian Sauce.</p>

<p>Put in the dish the peel of a quarter of a
lemon, three sprigs of parsley, one of thyme,
four button mushrooms, cut up small, a
walnut of butter, and a suspicion of garlic.
Hot up, and when all is well mixed pour in
half a cup of bouillon; let it get thick, but
not boil. Then take out the garlic, and add
half a walnut of butter.</p>


<p class="sec">Onion Sauce.</p>

<p>Cut up two good-sized onions into slices.
Simmer them gently with a tablespoon of
butter and two slices of ham, one fat slice
and one lean slice, a teaspoon of flour, salt,
pepper, a pinch of sugar, a wine-glass of
bouillon, and a good squeeze of lemon juice.
Hot up for three minutes.</p>


<p class="sec">Gubbins’ Sauce.</p>

<p>This is the best sauce I know, and I have
tried many, for grills or anything in that way.
I copy it verbatim (and without permission)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
from that most excellent food-book entitled
“Cakes and Ale,” by Mr. Edward Spencer.
Gubbins’ Sauce is peculiarly adaptable to the
Chafing Dish, and is made in this wise: Fill
the lower hot-water dish with boiling water.
Keep it so. Melt in the Chafing Dish
proper a lump of butter the size of a large
walnut. Stir into it, when melted, two teaspoonsful
of made mustard, then a dessert-spoonful
of vinegar, half that quantity of
Tarragon vinegar, and a tablespoonful of
cream—Devonshire or English. Season with
salt, black pepper and cayenne, according to
the (presumed) tastes and requirements of
the breakfasters. So far the recipe. I
should add that although the ingenious
inventor puts Gubbins’ Sauce with a grill
among his breakfast allurements, it is by no
means necessary to confine it to that meal. I
have found it excellent at midnight—and
later—with devilled kidneys, and it is not to
be despised at any time of the day when you
feel that way inclined.</p>

<p>“The Gastronomic Regenerator: a Simplified
and entirely New System of Cookery,”
by Monsieur A. Soyer of the Reform Club,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
London, 1846. Such is the mouth-filling
title of one of the most interesting and
curious works of the last century. The two-page
dialogue with Lord M(arcus) H(ill),
and the extraordinary recipe for “The
Celestial and Terrestrial Cream of Great
Britain,” are in themselves inimitable in
their quaint pomposity. <i>Maga</i> for August
1846 reviews the work kindly and good-humouredly,
and says that the “Gastronomic
Regenerator” reminds them of no
book so much as the “Despatches of Arthur
Duke of Wellington.” It may be a matter
of dispute, adds <i>Maga</i>, whether Wellington
or Soyer acquired his knowledge in the
face of the hotter fire. Although Soyer was
comic in his pompous affectation it must not
be forgotten that he did splendid work in
the Crimea in feeding the sick and wounded.
Also his sauces are master works. And for
these two things much may be forgiven
him.</p>

<p>The foregoing sauces are best described
as the regulars. There are plenty of others,
mostly of a rather elaborate description,
which those more experienced than myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
must describe. I will content myself with
adding quite a few irregular or freak sauces,
if I may use the expression.</p>


<p class="sec">Fisherman’s Sauce.</p>

<p>This is a rather rich mixture, adapted for
fresh-water fish. After a decent day’s sport
with the tricksome Mayfly, the quarter of an
hour just before dinner may profitably be
employed in concocting it. Half a pint of
cream, or milk, but cream is better, two
tablespoons of walnut ketchup, home made
for choice, and one tablespoon of anchovy
sauce. Boil these up for five minutes, and
just before serving add a small walnut of
butter, a teaspoon of flour, a squeeze of
lemon, and a pinch of cayenne. Stir up all
together, and serve very hot. It is the best
fresh-water fish-sauce going.</p>


<p class="sec">Bigarade Sauce.</p>

<p>This is essentially the wild-duck sauce,
and is a welcome and agreeable variant on
the stereotyped port-wine sauce. Pare the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
rind of two oranges, shred the rind thinly,
and boil up for five minutes in as little water
as possible. Set the rind aside. Melt a
walnut of butter in the Dish, mix it with half
a tablespoon of flour, and stir it till it begins
to burn; add a cupful of bouillon, pepper
and salt, the squeezed juice of both oranges,
and a teaspoon of soft white sugar. Now
put in the shredded rinds, boil up for two
minutes, and serve with the duck. If you
have not time to make this sauce, mix a glass
of port wine, a dash of cayenne, and a squeeze
of lemon. Slice the breast of the duck and
pour this mixture over it. A very useful
adjunct to wild duck is a simple orange
salad. Divide two or three oranges into
sections, dress them with oil, vinegar, pepper
and salt, and eat it as you would any ordinary
salad.</p>


<p class="sec">Périgueux Sauce.</p>

<p>This is simply Truffle Sauce, and appeals
mainly to the vulgar-minded. It is made
thus: Chop up two truffles very finely.
Put them in the Chafing Dish with a glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of sherry and a walnut of butter, and boil
for five minutes; add pepper and salt and a
squeeze of lemon. I am of opinion that
truffles (which the ancients thought were the
product of thunder) should only be eaten in
one way, and that is <i>en serviette</i>, cooked in
hot wood ashes and eaten with praise and
thanksgiving. The flavour of truffles I take
to be one of the most perfect in the whole
category of food-stuffs. Their indiscriminate
use in shreds, choppings, patterns, and for
ornament, I consider to be a capital sin.
The <i>charcutier</i> is mostly to blame for this;
any old thing dressed up <i>aux truffes</i> he
considers a delicacy. One day a band of
knowledgeable eaters will slay all <i>charcutiers</i>.</p>

<p>Truffles suggest pigs; pigs suggest, to
me, Berkshire; and Berkshire a certain witty
lady who, speaking of a local magnate, a
self-made man, and a very wealthy one too,
but who retained his awfully uncouth manners,
described him as a wild boar whom
civilisation had turned into a pig. I fear
me there are many such.</p>

<p>One of the English Kings died of a
surfeit of lampreys, and one of the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Ministers of a surfeit of truffles, which were
also alleged to have mainly contributed to
the demise of the famous gourmand Béquet,
who was the predecessor of Jules Janin on
the <i>Débats</i>, and on whom Roger de Beauvoir
wrote this epitaph:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cy-gît Béquet, le franc glouton</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Qui but tout ce qu’il eut de rente;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Son gilet n’avait qu’un bouton,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Son nez en avait plus de trente!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>An ex-chef to whom I told this story of
Béquet was profoundly moved, and said
simply: “It must have been a beautiful
death!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> warm glow of virtuous satisfaction
induced by the knowledge that one has done
what was expected of one is my sole excuse
for the contents of this chapter. I have no
sweet tooth, and my experience in the
cooking of sweets has been limited to the
few recipes which come later on. Even
these I would rather have omitted, because
it is so easy to buy <i>éclairs</i>, <i>petits fours</i>, and
other “dulceties” wherewith to finish off a
Chafing-Dish meal, but it is just on the
confines of possibility that this book may be
read by a lady—or, if I am lucky, by two
or even three—and I should be indeed
accounted a poor instructor if I omitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
sweets from my curriculum. “I humbly
beg pardon of heaven, and the lady,” as
Mr. Pepys said when he kissed the cook.</p>

<p>“Give the bairns pudding in plenty, again
say I”—so wrote Sir Walter Scott, and I am
heartily at one with him, but Chaffinda does
not accommodate herself to the fabrication
of pudding—and, besides, children ought to
be in bed when supper-time brings the
Chafing Dish on the table. Baking is of
course impossible, and boiling in a cloth
equally so. I have already said that Chaffinda—being
so nearly human—has her limitations,
and these are two of them, which I,
for one, in no wise regret. Nevertheless,
pudding is a great institution—in its proper
place—which is childhood.</p>

<p>Our national Jack Pudding was a common
object of whilom country fairs, a sort of
typical buffoon who performed pudding
tricks on a stage; one of them being to
swallow a number of yards of black puddings
amidst yokel plaudits. Curiously
enough, and this is an etymological puzzle
well worth following up, the typical buffoon
of most European countries is christened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
after the commonest article of the daily food
of the people. France has her Jean Potage;
Germany, Hanswurst; Italy, Macaroni; and
Holland, Pickel Herringe. This can hardly
be a coincidence.</p>

<p>The learned Dr. Thudichum wisely says:
“The state of culture of every nation can be
estimated comparatively by its confectionery,
even when we know little of its cookery, for
confectionery is the most advanced and
refined part of cookery, and thus enables an
expert to draw a conclusion backwards
regarding the kind of cookery out of which
it originated.”</p>

<p>This is certainly true to a limited extent,
but to attempt a rough and ready analysis
on these lines is like dissecting a hummingbird
with a hatchet. Generalisations are as
dangerous as July oysters.</p>


<p class="sec">Apple Fritters.</p>

<p>Now for my sweets. The first one on the
list is the familiar Apple Fritter, or <i>Beignet
de Pommes</i>. It is quite easily cooked,
especially if a little care be taken over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
concoction of the all-important matter of
batter.</p>

<p>Begin by carefully peeling four apples,
fairly large ones for choice, then cut them
into slices, about one-eighth of an inch thick,
and take out the cores. Now make the
batter. Put four tablespoons of flour in a
basin with half a teaspoon of salt. Pour
one tablespoon of oil on to half a tumbler of
tepid water. They will not mix of course.
Add this gradually to the flour, stirring it
well. Next beat up two whites of egg to a
very stiff froth, and stir it lightly into the
flour. The batter is then ready for use.
The eggs should not be added until you are
quite ready to make the fritters. Now with
a skewer or fork take up the apple rings, one
by one, dip them in the batter, see that they
are well covered, and then drop them into
the Chafing Dish in which you have heated
two tablespoons of butter to boiling-point.
Fry the apples until they are soft, and of a
golden brown colour. Drain them on
kitchen paper, and sprinkle them with a little
castor sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Stewed Apples.</p>

<p>Apples, plainly stewed in slices, in milk
and sugar, and then served on a bed of rice,
are very satisfactory. The experimenting
Chafist will find that sweets can very often be
adapted so as to be suitable for the Chafing
Dish. But always rehearse your impromptus
before trying them in public.</p>


<p class="sec">Stewed Rhubarb.</p>

<p>Cut a pound of fresh sweet rhubarb into
two-inch lengths, put it in the Chafing
Dish with a tumbler of water, the peel of one
lemon, and a tablespoon of soft white sugar.
Let it boil up until the rhubarb is quite soft,
and then either serve hot, or—preferably—let
it get quite cold and serve with clotted
cream.</p>

<p>Almost any stoneless fruit can be cooked
in the same way. Gooseberries, currants,
strawberries, and raspberries all make excellent
compote, but care must be taken that
the fruit does not get pulpy: it should be
quite soft, but retain its proper shape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Quite ripe fruit is not so desirable as fruit
that is just going to be ripe.</p>


<p class="sec">Fried Pineapple.</p>

<p>Cut a smallish pine into half-inch slices,
paring the skin, of course, and split in half
three or four ordinary penny sponge cakes.
Fry these latter in the Chafing Dish in a
tablespoon of butter till they are light brown
on both sides. Take them out and keep
them hot. Fry the pine slices in a like
amount of butter and their own juice. Pour
over them a wine-glassful of brandy and
serve on the browned sponge cake. Cream
may be added, but it is not at all necessary.</p>


<p class="sec">Coffee Chestnuts.</p>

<p>Shell a dozen chestnuts, and boil them for
five minutes, then remove the skins. Put
them back in the Chafing Dish with enough
fresh water to cover them, and a tablespoon
of soft white sugar, boil them until they are
soft. Take them out and drain them, but
do not break them up. Now put in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Chafing Dish the yolk of one egg, another
tablespoon of soft white sugar, half a teacup
of strong black coffee, a liqueur of brandy
and a tablespoon of milk or cream. Keep
on stirring till just upon boiling, then pour
over the chestnuts, and serve hot.</p>

<p>It is not requisite to add brandy or other
spirits to the foregoing dishes. It certainly
tends to completeness of flavour, and, especially
with cooked fruits, seems to bring out
a subtle aroma or bouquet, but many most
estimable gourmets dispense with all spirits
in cookery, and are none the less well fed.
Spirits should never be given in food for the
young.</p>

<p>A Surrey curate opened the Sunday School
one day with the well-known hymn, “Little
drops of water, little grains of sand.” In
the middle of the first verse he stopped the
singing, and complained strongly of the half-hearted
manner in which it was sung. He
made a fresh start. “Now then,” he
shouted, “little drops of water, and for
goodness sake put some spirit into it!”
And he wore a blue ribbon in his buttonhole
too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>I should have liked to give the full recipe
for a seventeenth-century “Quelque-Shose,”
according to Master Robert May’s cook-book.
The ingredients read temptingly—if somewhat
lavish in quantity. Forty eggs are
required, which are to be made in the form
of omelets, which are to be “rolled up like
a wafer” and served with “white wine, sugar,
and juyce of lemon.” Another recipe of the
same artist was for “Pie Extraordinary, or
Bride Pie, which was made of ”severall compounds,
being of severall distinct pies on one
bottom.” At a rough guess this may have
been the forerunner of our latter-day Bride-cakes,
with their superimposed layers of
almond paste, and consolidated indigestion.
It is always marvellous to me that there are
so few sudden deaths after a wedding, particularly
if the cut cake has been handed
about promiscuously.</p>

<p>Bananas contain three times as much
nourishment as meat or potatoes, and as a
food are declared to be superior to bread.
They are as good raw as cooked, and my
only advice is to take care to buy the smaller,
more delicate kinds, and to avoid the grosser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
plantains, which are musty and flavourless.
The kind known as “Lady’s Fingers” are
the best of all.</p>


<p class="sec">Banana Cream.</p>

<p>Tear off a strip of skin from each of half
a dozen bananas. Put them in the Dish with
a tablespoon of milk, and a sprinkle of soft
sugar. Heat them up until the skins are
quite brown and the fruit soft and pulpy.
Then strip the skins, add some more sugar,
and serve with sponge-cake fingers.</p>


<p class="sec">Rice Milk.</p>

<p>Put in the Chafing Dish a teacupful of
clean boiled rice, rather more than a pint of
milk, a small stick of cinnamon, and a bay
leaf. Add a heaped tablespoon of soft white
sugar, and a suspicion of vanilla. Boil up
very slowly, and remove spices before serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Skansk Gröt.</p>

<p>There is a very good Swedish pudding,
known as Skansk Gröt, which is made in the
following wise: Boil in the Chafing Dish
half a pound of clean rice, with the peel of a
lemon, and half a stick of cinnamon, and a
cup of milk. Just before it comes to the
boil add four apples, sliced and cored but
not peeled, and a handful of stoned raisins, a
tablespoon of sifted sugar, and a wine-glass of
sherry. Boil all this for eight minutes, then
take out the lemon peel and the cinnamon
before serving. This Skansk Gröt can be
eaten hot or cold, with or without cream or
milk. It is good anyway.</p>


<p class="sec">Stuffed Figs.</p>

<p>Stuff a quarter of a pound of good pulled
figs with blanched almonds, split in half.
Put in the Chafing Dish a tablespoon of soft
white sugar, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and
a wine-glass of claret. Heat this up, but do
not boil. Add the figs, cover up, and cook
for eight minutes, when they ought to be
quite tender and ready to serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>


<p class="sec">Whisky Apples.</p>

<p>Peel and core, but do not cut up, four
largeish apples, not necessarily cooking ones;
in fact sweet eating apples are better. Put
them in the Chafing Dish with six tablespoons
of soft white sugar, the rind and juice
of half a lemon, and an inch stick of cinnamon,
a tiny bit of vanilla, and half a
tumbler of whisky. Let this simmer over
a low flame for a good half-hour, till the
apples are soft. When quite done put
them on a hot dish and pour the sauce
over them.</p>

<p>There is an old tradition among whist
players to the effect that there are at the
present moment seven hundred and fourteen
Englishmen wandering in destitution upon
the continent of Europe, because they would
not lead trumps when they held five. I do
not desire to find myself in a like case, so I
have played my trumps, and must abide by
the consequences. I do not propose to
invent impossible sweets which I have not
tested in the Chafing Dish, give them high-falutin’
titles, and palm them off on unsuspecting
and all-confiding Chafing students.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Let them turn inventors themselves, and my
blessing go with them!</p>

<p>I have purposely said little or nothing on
the subject of appropriate drinks to accompany
Chaffinda’s efforts, because that is, to a
certain extent, a personal matter. At the
same time it may be useful to know that it
is very easy to mature cheap claret. The
trick is French, and fairly reliable. It happens
sometimes that the ordinary dinner claret of
commerce leaves something to be desired in
the way of flavour and palatability. It may
be sour, acrid, harsh, biting, vinegary, and
half a dozen other things, all unpleasant.
Add to a glass of such ordinary wine a teaspoonful
of very hot water. The effect is
usually magical. The wine seems ten years
older. It becomes softer, mellower, suaver,
and really almost drinkable. <i>Le petit vin
bleu du pays</i> becomes almost a <i>cru</i>.</p>

<p>Some people drink coffee after dinner, and
eke after lunch, if they have time—and lunch.
Others use it as a barometer. You can do
both, if you know how. It is very simple.
The coffee must be very hot. Drop a lump
of sugar into the cup, and before stirring it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
observe how the bubbles rise. If they rush
towards the middle of the cup and meet, then
it is going to be fine weather. If they remain
close to the edge of the cup it will rain
or snow. If they separate but wander about
vaguely, then the weather will be changeable.
This barometer is not infallible, but it has
been known to be accurate. Try it. Café
frequenters on the boulevards spend hours in
checking the prognostications of their coffee
by the weather reports in the papers.</p>

<p>I should like to give a few final hints on
Chafing-Dish party-giving, the result of my
own experience, which has been both bitter
and sweet. Imprimis: “Don’t ask too many
people,” as H. J. Byron said on his deathbed,
when his coachman told him that one of his
horses was ailing and he thought he had
better give him a ball. “You should always
be two,” quoth the Abbé Morellet, “to
eat a truffled turkey. It is my invariable
practice. I am going to dine off one to-day.
We shall be two—the turkey and myself.”</p>

<p>A fellow feeding makes us wondrous kind,
and I do not for a moment suggest that
Chafing-Dish meals should always be soli, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
from it; a duet is delightful, a trio tactful,
and a quartet quieting. I cannot advise
going beyond that number. Chaffinda is
always present, of course, but she does not
count as company, she is merely the hand-maiden,
the <i>geisha</i>, the tutelary genius
hovering over the meal.</p>

<p>I have already enjoined the absolute
necessity of rehearsal; leave nothing to chance.
If you want to make your little effect, see
that it is properly stage-managed: your
properties ready, your limes in working
order, and your band parts ready and complete.
“In the green salad days of my
youth, when I rarely spoke aught but the
truth,” I tried more than once to dazzle my
guests with unrehearsed effects, but in every
case the result was dire failure. All that
sort of thing is magnificent, but it is not
cookery.</p>

<p>Again, do not attempt too elaborate a bill
of fare. Be pre-Raphaelite in your attention
to detail rather than Academic in your mass
of lavish decoration. Of two evils choose
the prettier, and prefer a discreet little meal
of soup, meat, vegetable and savoury, to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
elaborate programme which defeats its own
ends, and clogs the appetite.</p>

<p>It is such much better form to be
simple, poor and proud—besides, it costs less.
About forty years ago the late Lord Sidney
Godolphin Osborn wrote a letter on the
growing love of luxury to the <i>Times</i>, in the
course of which he said: “The wealthy per
force of their positions must have large
expensive establishments; they are doomed
to live in show houses; they are the proper
consumers of the produce of the decorative
arts; but they yet have to eat, and here
comes the question. How can they eat in
character? How can they dine up to their
pictures, sculpture, plate, and music?”</p>

<p>The answer is easy enough. They can
never dine up to their pictures, because
they are usually dyspeptic.</p>

<p>“I had some hopes of the cook at first, but when
I talked to her tightly and closely, I could make
nothing of her: she was all wiggle-waggle, and
I could never persuade her to be categorical.”<br>

<span class="pad"><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span> (“D’Arblay’s Memoirs”).</span>
</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Some</span> of us have been to school. It was
usually a long time ago. Still, here and there
a man with a memory may recollect that
when Achilles, in the “Iliad,” has granted
the request of the unhappy Priam in reference
to the dead body of his son, his next
remark to the old man is an eminently practical
and sensible one: “Let us now go to
dinner!” It has struck me that this classical
allusion may have been one of the reasons for
the erection of the Achilles statue at Hyde
Park Corner; just to remind late dawdlers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the Park that dinner-time and dressing-tide
wait for no man or woman.</p>

<p>I have already had the presumption to
suggest that we eat too often and too much
and too late and too elaborately; this has
emboldened me to further frankness. A
French friend who “knew himself” in dining
matters said to me once: “En Angleterre on
se nourrit bien, mais on ne dine pas.” He
was both right and wrong. Right as regards
the very pseudo-French cookery of the
affluent middle-class, wrong as regards the
best restaurants and hotels.</p>

<p>Buckle, in his “History of Civilisation,”
following Cabanis, considers food as one of the
four physical agents most powerfully influencing
the human race. Men’s manners and
morality, their customs and condition, depend
mainly on what they eat. The boldness of
the Norseman and the timidity of the Bengalee
are justly due to their respective preference
for meat or vegetables, for carbonaceous
or nitrogenous diet. Slavery in India
is the direct result of rice, in Egypt of dates,
of maize in Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, adapt ourselves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
circumstances in so far as the circumstances
adapt themselves to us. It is no longer
fashionable to get drunk, and in a generation
or two it will be the worst kind of form to
eat more than three courses at dinner.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you eat and I will tell you
what you are,” said Brillat-Savarin, Judge of
the French Court of Cassation in 1826, and
<i>not</i> a professed cook, as so many folk seem
to imagine. He goes on to say: “The
gourmets by predestination can be easily told.
They have broad faces, bright eyes, small
foreheads, short noses, full lips, and rounded
chins. The females are plump and pretty
rather than handsome, with a tendency to
<i>embonpoint</i>.”</p>

<p>This is not complimentary, and does not
seem to be borne out by experience. Women
gourmets are fewer than men, but they make
up in knowledge what they lack in number.
Both Goethe and Byron have left it on record
that they objected to seeing women eat, but
nowadays, with better table manners, it is not
a disagreeable sight, except perhaps at a Swiss
<i>table d’hôte</i>.</p>

<p>An English dinner-party, in the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
year of grace, is not at all ugly. It may be—and
sometimes is—almost a thing of
beauty. The modern dinner-table approaches
as nearly to the old Greek type as is compatible
with the widely divergent character
of the two civilisations. It certainly follows
the classic pattern in two valuable particulars—beauty
and repose. True, we do not
wreathe our heads in roses, nor carry doves
nestling in the folds of our robes, nor pour
libations of wine over one another (such a
messy habit!), but we have done away, for
good and all, let us hope, with the dreadful
mid-Victorian table decorations. Instead of
hideous dish-covers, branching candelabra,
hideous <i>épergnes</i>, and appalling “set pieces,”
we have Hawthorn bowls of roses, delicate
Venetian glass, beaten copper finger-bowls,
perfectly plain silver, and the simplest of
white china. Everything perfect of its kind,
and its kind the non-ostentatious.</p>

<p>We have also become franker in the
honest avowal of our appetites. Even in our
grandmothers’ time it was considered somewhat
immodest to take a second helping
without being pressed. Pressure was expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
as a politeness from the host. An old
manual of table etiquette says: “Offer every
dish at least thrice to each guest. Timid
appetites must be tempted, for they exist
still, especially among literary folk!”</p>

<p>Altogether we are much politer, outwardly
at any rate, than we used to be. Even a
Royal Duke has manners. So he had formerly—but
they were mostly bad. It is told
of one of the Royal Family, of a couple of
generations ago, that he was dining at Belvoir,
and his host, noticing His Royal Highness
studying the menu at dinner, asked him
if he would like anything that did not appear
on the bill of fare. “Yes; roast pig and
apple dumpling,” was the gracious reply.</p>

<p>The daring simplicity of the royal appetite
is splendid, but the pity is that it was
not more pleasantly put.</p>

<p>Another reform in our dining arrangements
is the greater love which folks now
bear to fresh air. Formerly dining-rooms
were heated up as though the guests were
early cucumbers, and wanted forcing. This,
I am sure, contributed greatly to the dulness
of the average dinner-party. As the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of careful observation, I have found, by experimenting
with a thermometer, that at a
temperature of 62° Fahrenheit conversation
flows easily and every one’s wits are at their
best and sharpest. At 75° or higher the
most elastic spirits become subdued. If any
one says to me: “So-and-so was not himself
last night at dinner,” I am always tempted to
ask: “What was the temperature?”</p>

<p>Why will people, when they dine out in
public places, insist on having music? It
seems to me a confusion of the arts, and with
little ear for music I cannot bring myself to
take my soup in polka time, or masticate my
whitebait to the <i>Intermezzo</i> from “Cavalleria
Rusticana.” It is quite a modern fad, for in
1874 G. A. Sala discusses music at dinner
in a magazine, and only refers to it in royal
palaces. With all deference to those who
know better, it seems to me to be rather
rude to good music, and to a good dinner.</p>

<p>All the foregoing is in direct relation to
the art of the Chafing Dish, because the
refinement of modern cookery is nowhere
more evident than in dealing with Chaffinda.
I have been to a dinner-party where two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Chafing Dishes were brought on to the table
after the sweets, one being placed before the
host and the other before the hostess. Deft
servants handed the necessary ingredients,
and in five minutes, the guests (we were
eight, I think) were enjoying a little egg
savoury, piping hot, and cooked before their
eyes. This sort of thing may become quite
common. Who knows?</p>

<p>The table for an ordinary Chafing-Dish
meal, whether luncheon, dinner or supper,
such as might be cooked after a diligent
study of the foregoing chapters, should be
arranged as simply as possible. One end
bears the Chafing Dish on its own little tray
and cloth. The remaining three-quarters of
the table may be laid for a smallish party,
and, by all the canons of good taste, avoid
decorating it with tulle or nun’s veiling, or
chiffon, or whatever the silly, flimsy, puffy
stuff is called. You might as well put
ostrich feathers and bombazine in the middle
of the table. Good simple glass and china,
the older the better, as a rule, because the
forms are more beautiful; and I see no need
for uniformity in either service, so long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
each individual piece is beautiful in itself.
Pewter plates retain the heat splendidly, and
some of the old ones are excellent in design.
Wooden platters are affected by some people
for meats, and I confess that the red juice
of the meat on the well-scrubbed surface is
very pleasing. Keep the centre ornament
very low, so that one can see and talk across
it. A big dish of almost any old blue and
white ware, with a very few flowers, but each
bloom perfect in itself, is my own ideal.
Nothing is more trying than to talk to your
opposite neighbour across a small table,
through a mass of tightly packed towering
flowers, or a jungle of dense fern. It is
not beautiful, but just annoying.</p>

<p>Chafing-Dish cookery, I am delighted to
be able to add, seems to engender the love of
beautiful things. It is so easy to pick up
and use, in parlour cookery, all sorts of
quaint and delightful pieces of china of
curious and old-fashioned design. They
may not all be genuine; in fact, most of
them are pretty certain not to be. But if
the shape is good, the colouring pleasing,
and the form well adapted for holding sauce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
sweetmeats, condiments, or anything else,
then, so far as Chaffinda is concerned, their
genuineness and intrinsic value is a secondary
matter.</p>

<p>One is occasionally tempted by the offer
of a real old silver Chafing Dish with or
without an ivory handle. Cooking in such
an implement would be an ultra refinement
of the art. But the temptation must be
resisted, such things are not for daily use,
although at one time and in some houses
a silver dish no doubt was always put before
the master, wherein to make his Welsh
Rabbit.</p>

<p>There is a sort of huge silver Chafing
Dish in the Cluny Museum, which rather
suggests a cauldron, so vast are its dimensions.
It is evidently fairly old and has
seen much use, though it is not quite evident
what could have been cooked in it, unless
it were the original <i>marmite</i> of Monsieur
Deharme, which never left off cooking.</p>

<p>Grimod de la Reynière places on record,
as an example to all good cooks, this
extraordinary <i>marmite</i>—or stockpot—of
Monsieur Deharme, a restaurateur in the Rue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
des Grands-Augustins. He calls it “the
everlasting <i>marmite</i>,” as, at the date of
writing (1803), it had not been off the fire
for eighty-five years! During that time it
had cooked at least three hundred thousand
capons, for Monsieur Deharme’s specialty
was the purveying of well-cooked hot capons
at any hour of the day and night. His
establishment was always open, and the
procession of succulent birds to the <i>marmite</i>
was unending; in fact, the Deharme fowl
was regenerated perpetually in one long
procession of—apparently—the same bird,
born anew for each successive customer.
The author adds that this <i>marmite</i> was
celebrated throughout Europe—and no
wonder.</p>

<p>In preparing some of the recipes in
preceding chapters, Chafers may find some
difficulty, if it be summer-time, in keeping
one portion of the dish hot whilst the other
portion is cooking. When I have no fire in
the room, I use a copper tray with two spirit
lamps underneath. This is a splendid invention
and no Chafer should be without
one. Then there is another useful thing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
remember. The lower hot-water dish, if
filled with water and put over the lamp,
only half turned up, will keep food warm in
the Chafing Dish for ever so long. This is
often useful to know, as it is so pleasant to find
something unexpectedly prepared and ready
when one had feared that all the cooking
had to be done by oneself. After a late
night’s work such a surprise is very comforting.</p>

<p>In preparing a Chafing-Dish meal it is
important to remember the sequence of
cooking, so that the waits between the
courses shall not be too long. I use two
Chafing Dishes, so that there need be no
delay; one can be cleaned whilst the other
is in use. If you are making soup, have the
fish ready so that it only wants hotting up.
If your second course takes a little time, fill
up the interval with something cold, or a
salad. Work out your plan carefully beforehand
so that there can be no possibility
of accident, and if the occasion be special,
and you wish to shine to your very best
advantage, I earnestly recommend you to
have a full-dress rehearsal the day before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
and time yourself accurately for each dish;
then there can be little chance of failure.</p>

<p>The setting forth of menus seems to me
to be an entirely futile method of filling up
a cook-book. No one ever follows them,
because things never happen just so as to
make all the materials simultaneously available.
It is much better to dip here and
there in a book—to choose a soup, a meat,
and a salad; or a fish, a bird, and a savoury;
or a soup, a fish, and a sweet (an it be
Friday)—to suit your convenience, pocket,
and taste of the moment.</p>

<p>Further, as I have already explained, I do
not pretend to have done more than touch
on the fringe of the possibilities of the
Chafing Dish. I have only described what I
have done, and hinted at what others may
do. But what I particularly want to draw
attention to is the scope for original research
in the cult of Chaffinda. A long winter’s
evening is much more profitably spent experimenting
with the Chafing Dish than—well,
playing Patience, for instance.</p>

<p>I do not desire to make every unmarried
man and woman a cook. Far from it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
But it would do us no harm to think a little
more of the quality of the food we eat, and
less of the quantity. Few of us, however,
are so stomach-ridden as Mynheer Welters,
Burgomaster of Dilburg, in a delightful
novel published thirty years ago, called “The
Burgomaster’s Family,” by Christine Muller,
and translated from the Dutch by Sir John
Shaw-Lefevre. Burgomaster Welters worshipped
his stomach. What a good dinner
was to him no words can express. It was
the realisation of all his dreams and wishes.
The content of soul and the feeling of
philanthropy which his eyes expressed after
such a dinner must have been seen to be
described. He was accused of marrying
Widow de Graaff because she knew the
recipe of a certain pie which she would not
divulge at a less price than marriage. If
any one spoke of glorious summer, he only
thought of early vegetables; France reminded
him of Veuve Cliquot, and Germany
of Bavarian beer.</p>

<p>An American Chafing-Dish book in my
possession contains the following quaint
apothegm: “The Chafing Dish not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
makes possible the sincerest expression of
the most perfect hospitality, but it seems the
true symbol of good fellowship.” The
sentiment herein expressed is unimpeachable,
and I should like to be able to use such
pretty talk myself. It is exactly what I
wanted to explain, but being clumsy in the
expression of intimate feeling, I cannot
